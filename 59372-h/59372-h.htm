  <h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

  <p class="drop-cap">
    IT is full fifty years since I began to contemplate the Alfred Jewel
    with a wonder and curiosity which became a habit. At length, in the
    latter half of that period, the vague attitude of enquiry began to
    point in a definite direction, and to exhibit susceptibility of
    development suggesting promise of possible discovery. Prompted by
    such anticipations, I one day ventured to express a wish to the
    Principal of Hertford College that he would exercise his well-known
    graphic talent upon the Alfred Jewel, and make some enlarged drawings
    of it suitable for a Public Lecture. The result was that he gave
    me a beautiful set of coloured drawings of the Jewel in various
    aspects admirably calculated for exhibition in the Lecture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> Room.
    Thus equipped, I was able to make the subject more intelligible and
    more attractive, and I lectured upon it the oftener. As it has not
    been my wont to write my lectures out in full, it was all the more
    necessary for me on every new occasion to make a fresh study of the
    Jewel. In this recurring process new lights rose at wide intervals of
    time, and drew me on to devote more thought to the object and to the
    times associated with it; and I found more than I had looked for in
    the design, and more (I think) than I should have found, but for the
    generous aid so readily extended to me by Dr. Boyd.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was after such a lecture delivered in May, 1899, that I had the
    great and unexpected pleasure of a proposal from the Delegates of the
    Press to make a book of it. I was able to accept this proposal without
    misgiving, because I was satisfied that I had a solid interpretation
    to offer—one which had been slowly matured and scrupulously tested by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
    every means in my power. All the old theories had come to nothing:
    there was not one of them that could be seriously advocated as resting
    upon evidence either in history or in common sense and the natural
    reason of things. In saying so much as this, I am only accounting for
    my readiness to accept the task, and not by any means prejudging the
    general verdict upon the validity of my argument. In this argument I
    seek to establish the intimate relation of the Jewel with the history
    and the mind and the person of Alfred of Wessex, not indeed as a
    scientifically demonstrated fact, but as a well-founded and abundantly
    supported probability. I have no desire that this conclusion should be
    admitted without a complete and rigid scrutiny.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the carrying out of this undertaking I have received welcome and
    much-needed help from many quarters. The subject is one that calls for
    illustration by maps and drawings and I desire to express my sincere
    acknowledgements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
    to Mr. Alfred A. Clarke of Wells for his four
    drawings, among which I will particularly mention his characteristic
    landscape of the Isle of Athelney.
  </p>

  <p>
    The map of Athelney and the lands adjacent is very ingeniously devised
    for exhibiting the contrast between the low level of the moorland
    and the contours of the rising country around; it is expressive and
    intelligible at a glance: and for this excellent illustration my
    acknowledgements are due to Mr. Bernhard V. Darbishire.
  </p>

  <p>
    My hearty thanks are due to Mr. Charles H. Read of the British Museum
    for the ample information he kindly afforded me concerning the gold
    rings of the Saxon period which are in his department. Also for the
    permission which he gave (as Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries)
    to transfer to these pages their engraving from the Book of Kells, and
    also their three figures of the gold ring of queen Æthelswith.
  </p>

  <p>
    To those gentlemen of Somerset who have aided me with local
    information and hospitality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
    and personal guidance, I have good cause
    to be always grateful. Major Barrett, junior, of Moredon, the owner
    of the Isle of Athelney, took me over the ground in a manner that is
    very agreeable to remember, and caused me to see the historical sites
    of his country with every advantage. It was under his auspices that I
    first realized the full import of Alfred’s fort at Borough Bridge, and
    what a speaking object-lesson it certainly is. I had seen it in 1856,
    but I had not adequately appreciated it.
  </p>

  <p>
    From Mr. Cely Trevelian of Midelney Place I learnt much that was
    useful to me concerning the history and present conditions of the
    moorlands of Somerset. He was my hospitable friend and companion over
    the country on either side of the Parrett in the circle of Langport,
    and from that to Borough Bridge. Under his guidance I revisited
    Aller (pronounced Oller), and renewed acquaintance with its sacred
    associations, after an interval of forty-four years. In 1856 I was
    conducted by an old Oriel friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
    who was my host, the Rev. James
    Coleman, then Curate of the parish in which Athelney is situated; he
    subsequently became Vicar of Cheddar and Prebendary of Wells. When I
    entered upon the present work, after so long an interval, it was with
    Mr. Coleman that I began to make enquiries for local information.
  </p>

  <p>
    To Sir Alexander Acland Hood I am indebted for genealogical and
    topographical information, and particularly for some new light on
    the history of the Jewel, now for the first time made public. The
    statement in the manuscript of Mr. Thomas Palmer, which is preserved
    at Fairfield, that the Jewel was ‘dug up,’ is a new item in the
    circumstances of the discovery, to which I attach important evidential
    weight.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have also to thank Sir Cuthbert Slade of Maunsel, for his courtesy
    in answering my enquiries, genealogical and territorial, concerning
    the Slade family.
  </p>

  <p>
    On Mr. C. F. Bell, the Assistant Keeper of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
    Ashmolean Museum, I
    chiefly depended for help in that part of my subject where I was most
    wanting, namely in the technicalities of ancient art, and especially
    concerning enamels.
  </p>

  <p>
    To my friend Dr. Shadwell my obligations are not the less but the
    greater for that they are somewhat indefinable. He has read through
    the proofs, and has given me valuable suggestions, and he has always
    been ready to help when I needed advice.
  </p>

  <p>
    For me this trinket has assumed the proportions of a serious
    historical problem, and its investigation has been rewarded with
    new light in many directions, and I do not think I shall regret the
    time spent upon it, even though my conclusions should hereafter be
    modified or even refuted. I hold that, apart from the conclusions, the
    investigation itself was worth the while, but when I say this I am
    not to be understood as admitting that I have little confidence in my
    conclusions.
  </p>

  <p>
    In putting forth this Essay, I desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
    convince the reader only
    as fully as I am convinced myself, that is to say, with a conviction
    which makes no claim to finality, but lies open to correction in case
    of new light or better use of old data; yet which nevertheless, in the
    mean time and for the main issues of the enquiry, reaches a degree of
    probability whereby all doubt and uncertainty is practically excluded.

  </div>

  <p class="drop-cap">
    THE subject of this Essay is preserved in the Ashmolean Museum, which
    has been its home for a period of time now approaching two hundred
    years. It is there installed under glass in such a manner that every
    side of it is plainly exhibited to the eye of the visitor. It bears an
    inscription in conspicuous lettering which sets forth that by Alfred’s
    order it was made, and this is the ground upon which it is known as
    <span class="smcap">The Alfred Jewel</span>.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="450" height="198" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
    The Alfred Jewel has been compared to a battledore, not untruly
    for the matter of shape; but the wide diversity of size makes the
    comparison seem incongruous. The extreme length of the Jewel is a very
    small fraction under two inches and a half; its greatest width is just
    one inch and a fifth; its thickness barely half an inch.
  </p>

  <p>
    It contains a sitting Figure enamelled on a plate of gold which is
    protected in front by a slab of rock crystal, and at the back by
    a gold plate engraved; the whole enshrined in a golden frame of
    delicately executed filigree work. The picture is visible through the
    rock crystal, making the obverse of the Jewel; while the reverse is
    formed by the gold plate which is at the back of the enamelled plate.
    Upon this gold plate is engraved an allegorical design. Both these
    surfaces (obverse and reverse) are flat, but in every other part of
    the Jewel the surface is rounded.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rounded contours may be likened to those of a pigeon’s egg. If we
    imagine a longitudinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
    section of a pigeon’s egg, the engraved plate
    at the back of the picture will correspond to the plane of the egg’s
    diameter. From this plane, if we measure three-quarters of an inch in
    the girth of the egg, and then take another section parallel to the
    gold plate at the back, we obtain the front surface of the crystal,
    through which the Enamel is visible.
  </p>

  <p>
    The effect of this arrangement is, that the sides all round the Jewel
    are curved and sloping, and that the obverse is of more contracted
    area than the reverse, and also that the measurement of the sloping
    side exceeds that of the thickness. The head of the sitting Figure
    occupies the broad end of the oval section; the smaller end is
    prolonged, and is fashioned like the head of a wild boar on the
    obverse, but the reverse of this head is flat and covered with
    fish-like scales.

    The snout is projected in the form of a socket adapted to receive a
    peg or stem; athwart this socket is a cross-pin, having a head at
    one of its ends, while the other end is riveted. This indicates that
    the Jewel was furnished with a stem which has perished, and which,
    therefore, was not metallic, but of some organic material,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
    perhaps walrus ivory. Around the sloping sides runs a legend:
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_032.png" width="500" height="85" alt="✠ AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN" />
  </div>

  <p>
    and this legend starts from the narrowest point of the oval, beginning
    on the right-hand side and running round to the corresponding point
    on the left, so that it encircles the oval completely, running in the
    contrary direction to that with which we are familiar in our coins,
    which are read from left to right, as indeed were also the coins of
    the ninth century.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some have doubted whether the owner of the Jewel was the famous Alfred
    of Wessex. It has been urged that the name of <span class="smcap">Ælfred</span> in the
    Epigraph is not of itself adequate proof of the fact, and it must be
    admitted that this is literally true. And it is not superfluous to
    point out the inconsequence of such reasoning, for it has actually
    been advanced in serious argument. Samuel Pegge, an antiquary of
    repute, wrote in <cite>Archæologia</cite> ii as if there had been but one eminent
    person of the name of Alfred:—‘There is no doubt but this <i class="roman" xml:lang="el" lang="el">κϵιµήλιον</i>
    was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span> once the property of the great King Ælfred, notwithstanding the
    goodness of the work which has been an objection to its authenticity;
    for the king’s name is expressly mentioned in the inscription.’ There
    were many persons of that name in the course of the Saxon period, and
    the name was not confined to men born after his time, for there were
    persons of this name who were men of mark among his contemporaries,
    one of whom (to say the least) was certainly his senior.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Swithun died, in 862 (in Alfred’s fourteenth year), his successor
    in the See of Winchester was named <span class="smcap">Ælfred</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A contemporary of position and intelligence and of great wealth was
    that <span class="smcap">Ælfred</span> who redeemed from heathen hands a noble volume
    of the Gospels, and conveyed it by a solemn deed of gift in his
    own name and that of his wife to the brotherhood of Christ Church,
    Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. That volume is the
    <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Codex Aureus</i>, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> is now in the
    Royal Library at Stockholm. The Will of this Alfred, who in the course
    of that document styles himself ‘Elfred dux,’ is one of the most
    precious relics of Saxon antiquity<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few years after the king’s death, the Chronicle records, in 906, the
    death of an Alfred, who was Reeve of Bath.
  </p>

  <p>
    It has been argued that with such facts before us the ownership of
    the Alfred Jewel must be a matter of uncertainty, for we only know
    that it was ordered by a person of the name of Alfred. Such arguments
    may sometimes be heard from persons whose opinions are entitled to
    respect, but I am not aware that any one has undertaken to reason
    out and maintain this view in a published writing. And perhaps if we
    attend well to the whole of the evidence, we shall see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
    no cause to marvel at the unanimity of authors
    in accepting this Jewel as a personal possession
    of king Alfred’s, and (in some measure, diversely
    estimated) as a product of his own artistic design.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not the
    name by itself, but this name taken in connexion with the richness
    and costliness of the work, with the thoughtful ingenuity of its
    device and composition, and with the symbolic meanings which must be
    assigned to certain parts of the structure;—such evidences as these,
    again combined with certain external evidences, namely, the locality
    in which the Jewel was found, and any affinities apparent in the above
    data with the career or exploits of the king, or with his character
    and tastes,—when the ownership is questioned, we find ourselves face
    to face with an accumulation of evidence varying in quality and
    requiring to be judged by the delicate and sensitive standard of
    probability. In presence of such a problem we should not neglect the
    impressions and expressed opinions of persons whose instincts have
    been cultivated in the sphere of such probabilities.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

  <p>
    George Hickes, in 1705, mentions some doubting critics, whose
    difficulty lay in the beauty and perfection of the work. They could
    not understand how such artistic work could proceed from Anglo-Saxon
    artists in the ninth century. But for himself, he added, the mere
    sight of the Jewel had been enough, and that from his first view of it
    he had never doubted that it was a personal possession of the great
    king Alfred<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    When an elaborate piece of workmanship like the Alfred Jewel is
    presented to the experienced mind and practised eye of a man like
    Hickes, the evidence is rapidly, almost unconsciously, sifted, and
    the probabilities converge to a focus, so as to produce a conviction
    which seems like a simple apprehension of the senses. I welcome
    Hickes’s expression of confidence as a confirmation of that which I
    have experienced myself. But while I am entirely free from uncertainty
    I quite recognize the reasonableness of the doubt, and I know that
    (logically speaking) the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> uncertainty is there. And I know also that
    many of my readers will entertain it and will look more or less
    dubiously upon the assumption of certainty in this matter. And,
    indeed, there is a certain advantage in having to reckon with this
    sceptical attitude of mind, insomuch as the presence of doubt has a
    stimulating effect in furnishing the discourse with a determinate aim
    and direction. It will set me on the alert, that I may not miss any
    incidental chance of a reflection tending to assure those who would
    be gratified to think that we do indeed possess a relic intimately
    associated with the person, and with the mind, of
    <span class="smcap">Alfred, king of Wessex</span>.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II<br />
      <span class="medium">THE EPIGRAPH OR LEGEND</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">We</span> must now consider and see what we can learn from the Epigraph. This
    was the cue whereby Hickes introduced the Jewel into the argument of
    his <cite>Dissertatio Epistolaris</cite>, and there gave us the cream of the
    discussions which had been developed in the space of twelve years from
    the discovery. Observing that in a Saxon inscription which Dr. Hans
    Sloane had communicated to the <em>Philosophical Transactions</em> (No. 247)
    only two letters of Anglo-Saxon form occurred, the C and the G, he
    proceeded to describe and discuss the Jewel in all the points of view
    which up to that time had occupied the attention of the curious. The
    forms to which he adverted were the angular C and G, which however are
    rather Epigraphic than Saxonic forms. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
    square letters occur (as Mr. Falconer Madan informs me) in the inscriptions of the sixth and
    seventh centuries in Gaul, Spain, and Britain. Hickes added that all
    the other letters of the Epigraph were in ordinary Roman characters<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>:
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_039.png" width="500" height="48" alt="AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN" />
  </div>

  <p>
    In fact there was only one place where a distinctly Saxon character
    might have come in, namely in the place of the W, which instead of the
    Runic Wên (ƿ) is composed of two Roman V’s. There is no place for
    the Runic Thorn (þ).
  </p>

  <p>
    He had been pursuing an argument, of which the aim was to show that
    from the time of Alfred the characteristic features of Anglo-Saxon
    writing were less used, being superseded by Gallic or Italic forms.
    He attributes the change to the teachers which the king had drawn
    from Gaul. That such a change was taking place in Alfred’s time is
    quite manifest, but its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
    beginnings were further back; the taste for
    Frankish fashions having been introduced by his grandfather Ecgberht,
    who had passed years of exile at the Court of Charlemagne. Doubtless
    the movement grew under the influence of Alfred, who not only had
    visited Rome, but in all probability had resided there for some years.
  </p>

  <p>
    If now passing from the alphabetic characters we consider the syntax
    of this sentence, we shall find that it varies so widely from our
    habits of speech at the present time as to furnish something like
    a measure of the intervening period, and as it were to render some
    account of the lapse of a thousand years. Let us begin by translating
    the sentence verbally with the minimum of change, retaining the
    selfsame words in their modern guise. On this plan the sentence will
    run thus: ‘Alfred me hight work;’ where the baldness of the diction
    exhibits roughly the gulf there is between this Epigraph and our
    present usage. Each word is English, but the sentence is far from
    being so. This great contrast is the result of a combination of
    causes, and it may be resolved into four chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
    movements which have slowly operated during the long interval.
  </p>

  <ol class="paren">
    <li>
      A change has taken place in the collocation of words in forming
      a sentence. The governed pronoun stands in a place where it is now
      inadmissible: the present habit of the language requires that the
      pronoun ‘me’ should come in after its governing verb. If we make this
      change, we shall see that the sentence will become a trifle more like
      English, thus: ‘Alfred hight work me.’
    </li>

    <li>
      Another movement is that which in process of time takes place in
      the usage of words. There is a fashion in the choice of words for the
      clothing of our ideas, and that fashion changes sometimes capriciously
      and fitfully, but for the most part so slowly and gradually that it
      takes an era of time to make the change conspicuous. Words are liable
      to this kind of alteration in various degrees, and this inequality
      of change is observable even in a sentence of four words. The verb
      <span class="smcap">heht</span>, <em>hight</em>, has undergone so great a change of sense that
      to the general reader it is apt to be unintelligible<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
      But while this verb has altered greatly, the verb ‘work’ has
      altered little. Still, it has altered, and it is no longer the right
      word for its place.
      <p>
        The remaining two words have in usage undergone no change at all. The
        pronoun <span class="smcap">mec</span> has suffered alteration in form by dropping a
        consonant, but it is absolutely unchanged in its application. Indeed,
        it may be stated as a general law, that pronouns as a class are among
        the slowest of words to admit semantic change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless there is a group of words which are still more
        unchangeable in signification, and these are the Proper Nouns.
        External changes of form they do admit, but not the internal change
        of sense. The name <span class="smcap">ælfred</span> is the form prevalent on the
        coinage of his reign, but there are variations, thus: <span class="smcap">ælfred</span>,
        <span class="smcap">ælbred</span>, <span class="smcap">elfred</span>, <span class="smcap">elfered</span>;
        and there is the form <span class="smcap">alfred</span>, which has become established in modern English
        in consequence of the fact that our earliest popular histories of
        the king were derived from Latin books, in which language his name
        was commonly spelt <span class="smcap">alfredus</span>. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
        whatever changes may pass
        over the visible representation of the word, there is no alteration
        possible in the relation between this word and the memory of that
        royal person whose proper name it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        If now we remove the words that have suffered a semantic change, and
        substitute those which at the present time seem most natural, the
        sentence will take this form: ‘Alfred ordered make me;’ and thus it
        approaches another step towards the present manner of our speech.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      The third movement to be noticed is that from the flexional
      to the phrasal method of syntax. The word <span class="smcap">gewyrcan</span> is a
      flexional verb, the last syllable, <span class="smcap">-an</span>, being the sign of the
      infinitive mood, and indicating the syntactical function of that word
      in the sentence. By slow degrees this method of syntax fell out of
      use, and another way came up of expressing the same function. Instead
      of the syllable <span class="smcap">-an</span> at the end of the verb, a little word,
      ‘to,’ was set before the verb, with the same effect of expressing the
      infinitive mood. If now we add this change to the other modifications
      of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> sentence, we shall bring it considerably nearer to current
      speech, thus: ‘Alfred ordered to make me.’ But still it wants
      something to reduce it into the shape which we can recognize as modern
      English.
    </li>

    <li>
      The fourth and last change which we must note in the habits of our
      speech is the great extension of the passive verb, and particularly
      in the infinitive mood. Many infinitive phrases which were once cast
      in the Active have been changed to the Passive, and a lingering
      survival of the active formula may be observed to have a peculiar and
      exceptional air. We feel this in the phrase, ‘The reason is not far to
      seek.’ A more familiar example may be seen on the boards of the house
      agents. Some of these boards say ‘House to let,’ while others prefer
      ‘House to be let,’—the one is homely and native English, the other is
      modish and reminds us of the schoolmaster. The same authority will
      guide us to bring our Legend up to date, and stamp our version with
      the mint of the nineteenth century, thus: ‘Alfred ordered me to be
      made.’
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In the above analysis it has been necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> to depart in some
    measure from the course of nature by exhibiting in succession a group
    of changes which are due to processes more or less simultaneous.
    This accumulation of gradual changes furnishes a measure, partly
    scientific, partly sentimental, of the wide interval that separates
    us from the time when this Epigraph was curiously woven in golden
    filigree by the lucky artist who executed the design of the ingenious
    prince.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the Epigraph has time-indications which are closer and more
    definite. There are features which, besides telling of the lapse of
    time, do also in some sense indicate the point of time; features in
    virtue of which this Legend may be said to suggest proximately its own
    date. The two words ‘<span class="smcap">mec heht</span>’ are archaic forms, the one of
    which is never, and the other rarely, found in the prose of the tenth
    century; indeed they were both archaic in the ninth. <span class="smcap">Mec</span> had
    given place to <span class="smcap">me</span>, and (though less absolutely) <span class="smcap">heht</span>
    to <span class="smcap">hêt</span>; but the older forms were still at the service of the
    poet, and Epigraphy has some share in poetic privilege. Indeed it
    would seem that in the time of Alfred <span class="smcap">mec</span> was consciously
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
    used as an archaic curiosity. There is a gold ring which I take to be
    contemporaneous with our Jewel, and it bears an English inscription in
    which <span class="smcap">mec</span> occurs twice. It will be described below<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It would be too much to say that the forms <span class="smcap">mec heht</span> convey a
    definite date, but they certainly fit well with the time of Alfred,
    and (but for that vague licence of Epigraphy) they might even be said
    to suggest the ninth century as the latest probable date of a work
    with which they are identified.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is worthy of notice that <span class="smcap">heht</span> occurs in another piece of
    Alfred’s inditing, which I will introduce here not only for the sake
    of the old reduplicative verb, but also because the passage is germane
    to the argument, and imports an illustration of a comprehensive
    kind. The king prefixed to his version of Gregory’s <em>Pastoral Care</em>
    a preface in prose and a prologue in verse. The prose preface was
    about the main purpose of his work; the poetical prologue dealt with
    literary matters, the authority of his text, the history of his copy,
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> manner of his own literary operation. It is this poetical and
    literary Prologue which I here quote:

    In the last six lines of this little poem a new attitude is taken

    <span class="smcap">ælfred</span> was the translator, how he ordered (<span class="smcap">heht</span>)
    more copies of his translation to be made, and for what purpose. In
    mentioning purpose, the prologue communicates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> something beyond the
    Legend, which leaves the purpose and signification of the design
    shrouded in symbolism. But for the rest, if we analyze these six
    lines, we shall find the heart and core of them to be essentially
    identical with the Legend on the Jewel—

      CHAPTER III<br />
          <span class="medium">EARLY SPECULATIONS ABOUT ITS DESIGN AND MANNER OF USE</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">The</span> finding of the Alfred Jewel chanced upon a remarkable time in the
    intellectual life of the English nation. It was the time of Dryden,
    Defoe, Swift, Christopher Wren, Bentley, Lord Somers, Sir Isaac
    Newton, Addison. In literature the coming man was Alexander Pope.
  </p>

  <p>
    The cardinal event of that period was the institution of the Royal
    Society in 1660, the year of the Restoration. The most conspicuous
    bent of the intellectual world was in the direction of physical
    science, and ‘the great work of interpreting nature was performed
    by the English of that age as it had never before been performed in
    any age by any nation<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.’
    This was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> period in which a national
    Observatory was established at Greenwich (1676). To this period belong
    the chemical discoveries of Boyle, the botanical researches of Sloane,
    and the classifications of Ray. In every department of knowledge
    enquiry was roused, and with it the genius of theory, whose movements
    were sometimes hasty and erratic. But this tendency was gradually
    counteracted by the deepening conviction that sound knowledge must
    be based on careful observation, and the need of museums began to
    be recognized. The Ashmolean Museum was built by the University of
    Oxford, in 1683, to receive Elias Ashmole’s collection of curiosities,
    the formation of which had originated with the Tradescants. The
    architect was Sir Christopher Wren. Altogether it was a time of new
    ideas and new institutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the Jewel was found, in 1693, it fell into the hands of persons
    who belonged both socially and intellectually to the foremost ranks.
    The first recorded owner was Colonel Nathaniel Palmer, of Fairfield
    House, in the region of the Quantocks. Of this house and this family
    some particulars will be related in the ninth chapter.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

  <p>
    The first notice of the Jewel was published by Dr. Hans Sloane,
    a Fellow of the Royal Society, eminent as physician, natural
    philosopher, and antiquarian. He was elected Secretary of that Society
    in 1693, the year in which the Jewel was found. Whether by reason of
    the new cloud of political and religious trouble which brooded over
    the land in the latter years of James II, or from whatever cause, so
    it was that the <em>Philosophical Transactions</em> had been suspended for
    the past six years, and they were resuscitated by the new Secretary,
    who was himself an active contributor. This remarkable man lived to a
    great age, and when he died, in 1752, in his ninety-second year, his
    museum was bought by the Government, and this purchase was the origin
    of the British Museum; for until the middle of the eighteenth century
    the idea of a national library and museum had never been entertained
    in England.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same Act of Parliament (26 Geo. II) which directed the purchase
    of the Sloane museum also directed the purchase of the Harleian
    collection of manuscripts which had been made by Robert Harley, first
    Earl of Oxford, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> name is also memorable in the study of the
    Alfred Jewel; for it was from an engraving furnished by Robert Harley,
    and made from a drawing of his own, that the first of the three
    figures in Hickes’s <cite>Dissertatio Epistolaris</cite> was printed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first published notice of the Jewel appeared in the <cite>Philosophical
    Transactions</cite> (No. 247 in 1698), and it was contributed by Dr. William
    Musgrave, Fellow of New College, physician in London, and an active
    member of the Royal Society, and author (1709) of <cite>Antiquitates
    Britanno-Belgicæ</cite>. He also contributed to Hickes’s <cite>Thesaurus</cite> the
    second and third figures of the Jewel which are there engraved<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    These were the eminent persons who prepared the material for the
    elaborate account which Hickes (1705) gave of the Alfred Jewel in the
    first volume of his <cite>Thesaurus</cite>. For the minutiæ of the description he
    was particularly indebted to Harley and Musgrave, who appear to have
    been occasional visitors at Fairfield House.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first impression which prevailed as to its design and use was
    that it might be an amulet. This was Dr. Musgrave’s first opinion.
    But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> afterwards he followed Hickes in supposing it was a pendant to a
    chain or collar of state, and Hickes even says (but here he must be
    simply repeating the expressions of his informants) that the cross-pin
    in the socket seems adapted to such a use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The boar’s snout is developed into a tubular ending which furnishes
    a socket with a cross-pin, manifestly asking a peg or (as artisans
    speak) a stert; and when this observation was maturely appreciated,
    it generated two inferences: (1) that there was no provision for
    attachment answering to the above theory; and (2) that in the position
    imagined, the picture would hang upside down.
  </p>

  <p>
    These criticisms opened the way for new observations and new
    conjectures. The antiquary Hearne interpreted the Jewel as if it
    were designed to be fixed at the extremity of a roller on which a
    manuscript was rolled, as a suitable ornament for some ceremonious
    presentation. But this hypothesis neglected the fact that the Jewel is
    made with an obverse and a reverse, a front and a back, which renders
    it quite unfit for such a position as Hearne had assigned to it.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

  <p>
    By Francis Wise and Samuel Pegge, chief antiquarians of the eighteenth
    century, it was imagined that our Jewel might have adorned the top of
    a stilus or ancient pen for writing upon a waxen tablet. In refutation
    of this theory it sufficed to observe how awkward and unwieldy an
    ornament it would prove to the penman.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nevertheless, this idea had a career, winning a momentary plausibility
    from the assumption that Alfred’s ‘æstel’ was a stylus. In
    <cite>Archæologia</cite> ii there is a letter signed ‘S. Pegge,’ from which I
    extract the following:—
  </p>

  <p>
    ‘It is not certainly known to what use this valuable curiosity ...
    might be put: but among other conjectures Mr. Wise imagines, and
    very probably, it might have been the handle of a stylus. And if
    one should say it was one of those styli which the king sent along
    with his translation of Gregory’s <cite>Pastoral</cite>, it would be no great
    absurdity.... It may here be alleged that the king sent his present
    to the cathedral churches: but, with submission, this does not imply
    that he might not also send the like to the two monasteries of his
    own foundation, this of Athelney and the other at Shaftesbury; it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
    most probable he would send a book and a stylus to both those places,
    and if he did, this jewel in my opinion bids fair to be the handle or
    upper part of the stylus which was presented by him to the House of
    Athelney where it was found.’
  </p>

  <p>
    Collinson, the historian of Somersetshire (1791), in a passage to
    be quoted below (chapter ix), designates it an amulet, and this was
    probably the way in which it was usually regarded in the eighteenth
    century. To this Pegge (in the article cited above) objected as
    follows: ‘Dr. Musgrave once thought it might be an Amulet, but Alfred
    never ran (that we know of) into such vanities.’
  </p>

  <p>
    Passing now to the nineteenth century, Mr. Philip Duncan, in his
    Catalogue of the Ashmolean Museum, advanced the theory that it might
    have been mounted on the top of a staff (after the manner of a Roman
    eagle), and that it was carried into battle as a standard to animate
    the courage of warriors. This exquisite bijou, of materials so brittle
    as enamel and crystal, cased in a delicate web of golden filigree,
    looks strangely inappropriate for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> fury of battle and the
    interchange of hard knocks.
  </p>

  <p>
    And indeed this theory was never suggested to its author by the reason
    or probability of the thing, but by certain texts which at that time
    were in better esteem than they are now, especially the hagiography of
    St. Neot, wherein it was said of this saint that he went before the
    king in war, carrying a palm and guiding him to victory, to all which
    the palm-bearing figure in the Enamel seemed to correspond. And this
    also explains why that figure was supposed to represent St. Neot.
  </p>

  <p>
    In like manner, Hickes was carried away by a passage in pseudo-Ingulph
    to abandon his first and best interpretation of the enamelled Figure,
    and to adopt the idea that it may have been intended to represent St.
    Cuthbert<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    All these speculations on the design and use of the Jewel are
    unsatisfactory and, considering the eminence and ability of the
    propounders, strangely poor in the craft of interpretation. If this
    surprizes us in an age when the minds of men were so much awakened, we
    should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> remember that the new movement was chiefly in the direction of
    physical science, and that little progress had as yet been made in the
    analysis of human history and the science of historical criticism.
  </p>

  <p>
    From these abortive attempts at interpretation, we gather that this
    singularly elaborate phenomenon of a Jewel had the effect of setting
    curiosity and imagination awork in the minds of those who contemplated
    it, and that some theory, however precipitate, became a sort of
    necessity. To this category must be added a more recent conjecture,
    which, as it proceeded from a highly honoured source, as it was
    persistently and circumstantially argued out, and as it has been
    widely accepted, demands a chapter by itself.

      </span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">The</span> theories about the Alfred Jewel which have been noticed hitherto,
    belong to the crude attempts at interpretation which were evoked
    by the surprize of the strange discovery in the last decade of the
    seventeenth century. We come now to a new theory which was broached in
    our own time by Bishop Clifford, in his Inaugural Address as President
    of the Somersetshire Archæological Society in 1877, when the Annual
    Meeting of that Society was held at Bridgwater.
  </p>

  <p>
    This theory demands a fuller attention than any
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
    of the foregoing, first, because it bears manifest
    tokens of maturer thought, but further, because there is much curious
    material woven into its fabric, which gives it independent value. If
    only for the single fact that it introduces a new explanation of the
    problematic ‘æstel,’ it ought to quicken the interest of every reader.
    It will be better on all accounts that the ideas of the author be
    presented in his own words:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Amongst the articles of church furniture used in the middle ages,
      frequent mention is made of ‘Baculi Cantorum,’ or choir staves.
      In the year 1222 there were eight such staves in the treasury of
      Salisbury Cathedral. ‘The staves at Canterbury Cathedral (writes Dr.
      Rock, <cite>Church of our Fathers</cite>, vol. ii) were as rich as they were
      curious, in the year 1315.’ He gives a list of them, and among them
      are ‘IV baculi de cornu, cum capitibus eburneis’—four staves of horn
      with ivory handles; others were adorned with gold and silver and
      precious stones. The use of these staves was to enable the Cantor or
      master of the choir to point out to the singers and to the readers
      their places in the book, and so prevent the manuscripts and their
      illuminations being soiled by the touch of fingers. When the lessons
      were read, the choirmaster not only pointed out the spot where
      the lesson commenced, but handed, if necessary, the staff to the
      lector, that he might use it to guide his eye along the lines in
      reading. This precaution was not only observed with regard to those
      beautifully illuminated volumes used for the church services,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> but
      was equally, if not more so, required in the case of books which were
      intended for the use of the general public. Most readers required
      to use their fingers to assist their eyes in following the lines,
      a practice which, if allowed, would not only soil the manuscripts,
      but in course of time obliterate them. Therefore when books were
      intended for public use it was customary to place by them a small
      staff or pointer for the use of the reader, even as in modern days
      a paper-knife forms one of the ordinary articles of furniture on a
      library table. In many instances these little staves or pointers were
      inserted in the binding of the books themselves, something after the
      fashion in which pencils are inserted in modern pocket-books.
    </p>

    <p>
      I may seem to be widely departing from Alfred and from Athelney, but
      you will soon perceive the pertinency of these remarks. Alfred, as
      you know, did much to encourage learning amongst his subjects, and he
      was especially anxious that useful works should be translated into
      English, and copies of them be arranged in public places, where all
      might gain access to them and read them.
    </p>

    <p>
      To encourage this good and noble work by his example he became
      himself an author. And he thus describes, in the preface which he
      wrote to the book he translated, the steps he took to start what I
      may call the first public reading in England:—‘When I reflected,’
      he says, ‘how the knowledge of the Latin tongue had fallen away
      throughout England, though many still knew how to read English
      writing, I began in the midst of divers and manifold affairs of this
      kingdom to turn into English this book (of St. Gregory the Great)
      which in Latin is named <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pastoralis</i>, and in English, <cite>The Herdsman’s Book</cite>;
      sometimes word for word, and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
      sense for sense, even
      as I had been taught by Plegmund my Archbishop, and Asser my Bishop,
      and Grimbald my Mass-Priest, and John my Mass-Priest. After I had
      learned of them how I might best understand it, I turned it into
      English. And I will send a copy to every bishop’s see in my kingdom,
      and in each book there is an aestel (i.e. a staff) of (the value
      of) 50 mancusses; and I command, in God’s name, that no man take
      the staff from the book, nor the book from the minster, seeing that
      we know not how long there shall be such learned bishops, as now,
      thank God, there be. Therefore I command that these remain always in
      their places, unless the bishop have them with him either to lend
      somewhere, or to have other copies made from them.’
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, then, we have the explanation of Alfred’s gem. It is the handle
      of a book-staff or pointer which, like those at Canterbury, and
      elsewhere, was made of horn (which has perished), the handle itself
      being of precious and durable materials. The inscription on it bears
      witness that it was made by Alfred’s order, ‘Aelfred had me worked;’
      and this circumstance, taken in conjunction with the costliness of
      its material and the beauty of its execution, makes it in the highest
      degree probable that it is one of those aestels which Alfred says
      were worked by his order, and inserted in the presentation copies of
      his translation of <cite>The Herdsman’s Book</cite>, and which were valued at
      50 mancusses, or (taking the value of the mancus at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) £18
      15<i>s.</i>, a large sum for those days.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if so, how came this gem to be found in this neighbourhood?
      Alfred presented one to each bishop’s see in his kingdom, and
      there was no bishop’s see in those days in these parts nearer than
      Sherborne, in Dorsetshire. You will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> have remarked that Alfred in his
      preface mentions four persons who assisted him in translating the
      book: Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury; Asser, Bishop of Sherborne;
      the Priest Grimbald, who presided over the school which Alfred had
      founded for the training of the English youth; and the Priest John,
      who was placed by Alfred as abbot over the monastery which he founded
      at Athelney. Copies of the book, each having a book-staff, were sent
      to Plegmund and Asser, for they both were bishops. Can there be any
      reasonable doubt that this mark of attention was equally observed in
      the case of the other two collaborators? More especially as Grimbald
      was at the head of Alfred’s school, and it was in order to promote
      English reading that Alfred had undertaken the translation of the
      book, and John, though not a bishop, was abbot over the monastery
      which Alfred himself had built in gratitude to God for the victory he
      had gained. A copy of the book, with the costly aestel in it, was no
      doubt sent by Alfred to his friend John, at Athelney, as well as to
      the other three collaborators. The book and the staff were, agreeably
      to Alfred’s order, preserved in the minster, till, in the days of
      trouble, (probably at the dissolution of the monastery,) both were
      hidden out of sight, and for that purpose buried in the grounds of
      some neighbouring friend at Newton Park, in the hopes of recovering
      them in better days. As time passed on, the secret of the place
      where they were hidden died with the man who had hidden them; and
      when after many years chance revealed the place of the deposit, the
      book itself and the perishable portion of the staff had rotted away,
      leaving only the gold and crystal handle, with the words, ‘Aelfred
      had me worked,’ to tell the tale. This I believe to be the true
      history of Alfred’s gem.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

    <p>
      When I visited the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, in the month of July,
      I was shown by the courteous Curator, by the side of Alfred’s jewel,
      a smaller specimen of ancient goldsmith’s work which was dug up a few
      years ago at Minster Lovel, in Oxfordshire, on the site of an ancient
      abbey. It is smaller than Alfred’s gem, but, like the latter, it is
      evidently the handle of a reading-staff. The handle of Alfred’s staff
      was made of a size that might be conveniently grasped in the hand;
      the one from Minster Lovel was intended to be held between the finger
      and thumb. It is smaller and less costly, but the workmanship of the
      gold is so like the larger one of Alfred as almost to suggest its
      being the work of the same man.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Thus Bp. Clifford would fain persuade us to see in our Jewel the
    costly handle of a pointing stave. This satisfies the requirement of
    the socket and rivet, which is a fit provision for the insertion of a
    fine stave. The only question at this point that could be raised in
    opposition is, whether the socket is not too small to admit a stave of
    useful thickness for the purpose contemplated. And as the author of
    this theory has applied it equally to the Minster Lovel jewel, this
    objection gains in force, as the rod that could be inserted in that
    little jewel would be of very doubtful service as a pointer.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

  <p>
    But when we consider the common elements in the design and workmanship
    of these two jewels, we are compelled to reject the theory that they
    were intended as handles to pointers. And first of the design. Both
    of these jewels have an obverse and a reverse, which in such an
    instrument would not only be unnecessary and unmeaning, but absolutely
    inconvenient and detrimental. Both of them are obviously designed to
    gratify the eye; as objects to be displayed in positions which they
    are to adorn and beautify. The Alfred Jewel contains the picture of
    a man in enamel, framed in golden filigree, glazed with crystal, and
    backed with a plate of gold curiously engraved; the whole composition
    plainly dictates which side is to be foremost and which end is to be
    uppermost when it is fixed in the position for which it is intended.
    Bp. Clifford’s theory cannot be accommodated to these conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    So much for the design: now as to the materials and workmanship. In
    both of these jewels the outer surface is filigree work of very fine
    texture; can it be imagined that this agrees with the suggested use
    of a handle to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> a choirmaster’s wand, whether we consider the implied
    defacement of the finest goldsmith’s work, or the galling friction to
    the musician’s hand?
  </p>

  <p>
    But besides appropriateness of design and workmanship, there is yet
    another condition to be satisfied, and one which this theory can
    only meet by means of a roundabout and arbitrary hypothesis. Any
    interpretation of the Jewel, to be satisfactory, must harmonize
    naturally and spontaneously with the Alfredian associations of the
    spot on which it was found. Bp. Clifford has felt this, and he has
    employed an elaborate machinery to meet it. The place of the find is
    one that naturally suggests direct and immediate connexion with the
    goings and comings of the king himself, for it lies near the centre
    of that region in which he spent some months of acute effort in the
    most critical juncture of his diversified and adventurous life. If our
    interpretation harmonize with the associations which are linked to the
    spot, and through the spot to the Jewel, probability is strengthened
    while the interest is heightened; but what possibility is there of
    bringing these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> associations to bear upon a costly book-pointer? If
    anything so extravagant existed, it might be preserved in the treasury
    of the minster or in the book-room of the cloister; but it could have
    no place about the person of a fugitive king and a struggling warrior.
    Accordingly the author of this theory is compelled to detach the
    interpretation from the personal history of the king, and to rest his
    solution of the problem upon a highly speculative assumption combined
    with the chances and vicissitudes of a later age.
  </p>

  <p>
    The author of this theory has to face the inevitable question—On the
    supposition that the Alfred Jewel is the handle of a book-pointer, how
    do you account for its being found in the neighbourhood of Athelney?
    In preparing to answer this question, he fetches a wide compass,
    enclosing in his sweep the literary achievements of the king, and
    seven centuries of the after-time. He begins by recalling Alfred’s
    acknowledgements to Plegmund, Asser, Grimbald, and John, for their
    help in his translation of Gregory’s <cite>Pastoral Care</cite>, and he recites
    the king’s statement that he would send a copy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> the translation to
    each bishop’s see, and with each book an ‘æstel’ worth 50 mancusses.
    It is an essential part of his theory that the ‘æstel’ was a
    book-pointer with a costly handle, and moreover that the Alfred Jewel
    was one of these handles. But there was no bishop’s see at or near
    Athelney, the nearest being at Sherborne: how then did this relic find
    its way to Newton Park by Athelney? The answer is that John the Priest
    became abbot of Alfred’s foundation at Athelney, and that there can be
    no reasonable doubt that Alfred gave the book and ‘æstel’ not only to
    Plegmund and Asser, but that he also extended his bounty to Grimbald
    and John, his two other collaborators<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. So the Alfred Jewel
    having thus arrived at Athelney as the handle of a book-pointer, was
    religiously preserved there until the time of Henry VIII, when it was
    buried to await better times, and in the course of nature forgotten.
    My objection to this is not that it is imaginative, but that it is ill
    suited to its purpose, because it is needlessly cumbrous, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> because
    the Jewel can be traced to Athelney by a much simpler and more obvious
    process.
  </p>

  <p>
    But while I find it impossible to admit Bp. Clifford’s theory as an
    interpretation of the Alfred Jewel, seeing that this relic absolutely
    refuses to be classed with the decorated handles of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">baculi cantorum</i>,
    I must add that the question of the ‘æstel’ stands apart.
    I am by no means prepared to maintain that the explanation of that
    problem which I have recently offered in <cite>Alfred the Great</cite> is
    preferable to Bp. Clifford’s. There is a close affinity between the
    two explanations; they both rest upon a common basis in the ancient
    gloss: ‘<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Indicatorium</i>, æstel.’ I interpreted the
    <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">indicatorium</i> to be
    a light slab, much like a flat ruler, which was to be brought to bear
    across the page so as to guide the reader’s eye, and perhaps furnish
    a rest for his fingers. The Latin term would fit a pointer as well as
    a flat ruler, and perhaps better. It may therefore well be that in
    the endeavour to interpret the Jewel, Bp. Clifford has incidentally
    explained that problematical object which king Alfred sent as a
    fitting accompaniment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> with each of the presentation copies of his
    version of Gregory’s <cite>Pastoral Care</cite>. The remark that the pointer
    might be fitted to the volume by an arrangement like that now in
    common use for attaching a pencil to a notebook must, I think, be felt
    to add a certain persuasive concreteness to his suggestion. Only then,
    if the ‘æstel’ was a book-pointer with a costly handle, that handle
    was certainly not fashioned after the manner of the Alfred Jewel, or
    of its natural associate the minor jewel of Minster Lovel—it was not
    fashioned with obverse and reverse.
  </p>

  <p>
    A subsequent interpretation by Llewellynn Jewitt, F.S.A., appeared in
    the <cite>Reliquary</cite> for October, 1879, vol. xx, p. 66:—‘Many, and very
    curious as well as various, have been the conjectures as to the use
    or origin of this remarkable jewel, and of the figure intended to be
    represented upon it, but it is not worth while to here repeat them.
    The probability, to my mind, is that it simply formed the head of a
    sceptre, and that just possibly it might have been ultimately given by
    Alfred to the head of the monastery founded by himself, to be used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
    as a pastoral staff or staff of office, as was the crosier in later
    days. The design and the workmanship are of exquisite beauty, and in
    all respects the jewel is unsurpassed by any other existing example of
    Anglo-Saxon art.’ Again, this interpretation, like that of Hearne and
    others, appears to be excluded by the formation of the Jewel with a
    front and a back.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the rejection of so many hypotheses the field of choice is
    narrowed, and our path should be so much the clearer to find the true
    design and use of the Alfred Jewel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V<br />
      <span class="medium">A JEWEL IN THE CROWN</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">The</span> Alfred Jewel is so made as to require a small stem or ‘stert’ for
    its fixture when in use. It tapers off to a socket, which is adapted
    to receive a small stem, and it is only when erected on such a stem
    that the Figure in enamel will appear in a natural position. How can
    we accommodate it with such a function as will correspond to these
    indications of design? Evidently not on the top of a standard-bearer’s
    pole, nor on the top of a stilus, nor at the butt-end of a
    music-master’s wand. It is moreover evident that the stem was a
    permanent fixture in the socket, for although the socket is now empty,
    this is due to the perishing of the stem, as appears from the fact
    that the cross-pin is riveted. The stem was therefore not metallic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
    but of some hard organic substance, perhaps walrus ivory. Our problem
    then is to discover a place in which this Jewel, permanently furnished
    with such a stem, could be so erected as to discharge some appropriate
    function. That function can hardly be other than personal decoration,
    and the place in which it might be erected is the helmet of the
    warrior.
  </p>

  <p>
    I imagine then that a hollow bead ran round the king’s helmet, along
    the rim next the forehead, and that over the very centre of the brow
    there was a round orifice in the upper slope of the bead, fitted to
    receive the ivory stem of the Jewel, and that when fixed in this
    position it would have minor jewels similarly fixed on either side,
    but that this one would be the central piece and the richest jewel in
    the crown or coronet. For this magnificent Jewel would have the effect
    of converting the helmet into a crown, transforming the most vital
    piece of defensive armour into the chief of royal insignia for public
    occasions of state.
  </p>

  <p>
    That the rudiment of the crown was derived from the helmet, at least
    among our people, seems to be indicated by the Anglo-Saxon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> word
    that preceded ‘crown,’ namely, <span class="smcap">cyne-helm</span>, which means Regal
    Helmet. This word is the only English representative of the idea
    before the Romanic word was domesticated among us. The term ‘crown’
    made its entrance after the Norman Conquest, at first in its original
    Latin form <span class="smcap">corona</span>, as may be seen in the contemporary
    <cite>Chronicle of Peterborough</cite>. Thus we read under the date 1085: Her
    se cyng bær his <span class="smcap">corona</span> and heold his hired on Winceastre
    to þam Eastran, ‘This year the king wore his Crown and held his
    Court at Winchester for the Eastertide.’ But the native word was not
    quickly superseded. In the next annal, 1086, we are informed that
    the king wore his Crown three times every year:—‘þriwa he bær his
    <span class="smcap">cyne-helm</span> ælce geare.’

    <div class="caption">THE MINSTER LOVEL JEWEL</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The explanation now offered of the use and function of the Alfred
    Jewel is confirmed by comparison with a minor jewel in the same glass
    case, which for its illustrative value has been placed by the Keeper
    of the Ashmolean Museum near the Alfred Jewel. In workmanship it is so
    similar that it might well be (as Bp. Clifford said) from the hand of
    the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
    maker. In design it is as much alike as it is possible for a simple
    and rudimentary pattern to resemble one that is highly elaborate and
    developed. No one can doubt that these two objects are fully analogous
    to each other, and that the service for which they were intended was
    of the same nature. This minor jewel has, like the Alfred Jewel, an
    obverse and a reverse; the obverse presents a Cross in opaque enamel
    <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cloisonnée</i>; the reverse has a gold plate, not engraved—as in the
    greater work—but equally with it suggestive of the back of a framed
    picture which is to lean against a vertical surface of some kind. As
    in the other, the area of the obverse is more contracted than the
    reverse, and the sloping sides are covered with a delicate filigree of
    gold. Lastly, this also has its projecting socket, with a cross-pin
    in its place riveted. It is in all respects adapted to be either the
    front and central jewel of a minor coronet, or else a lateral and
    subordinate jewel in the circlet whose front place was filled by a
    superior piece such as the Alfred Jewel.
  </p>

  <p>
    This minor jewel was found at Minster Lovel in Oxfordshire about the
    middle of the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> century. The finder brought it to a jeweller
    in Oxford, who, apprehending that the object was one of more than
    ordinary curiosity, carried it to Dr. Wilson, then President of
    Trinity College, an eminent archæologist, and the man who of all men
    in Oxford at that time was the most capable of estimating a find of
    this nature<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. The interest which he took in it was shared with Dr.
    Griffiths, who was afterwards Warden of Wadham College, and (whether
    by one or both) it was presented to the Ashmolean Museum. The date of
    this event does not appear to be recorded, but I suppose it must have
    happened in the fifties.
  </p>

  <p>
    That gold ornaments were proper for the helmet, we gather from a
    passage in the <cite>Beowulf</cite>, a poem which is now, I think, among critics
    of proved competency, allowed to belong to the eighth century. When
    Beowulf, after slaying the Dragon, lies fatally wounded, he puts off
    the chief pieces of his armour with the insignia
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
    of royalty, and bestows them upon Wiglaf, his faithful Thane and the
    natural heir to his throne. In the poetic description we perceive that
    the insignia are largely blended with the body-armour, and that the
    helmet is characterized by its golden decoration:

      <span class="medium">THE BOAR’S HEAD</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">There</span> is a feature in the Alfred Jewel which appears to support the
    theory propounded in the last chapter. I mean the Boar’s Head, which
    is so wrought into the composition of the piece as to represent a
    subordinate, or even a servile, relation to the saintly Figure which
    is seen through the window of crystal.
  </p>

  <p>
    About the creature indicated by this head there has been some
    diversity of opinion. It has been spoken of as the head of a serpent,
    of a fish, of a dolphin, and strangest of all, it has been called the
    head of a griffin. Of these notions the last is the one that has been
    oftenest repeated, and yet it is the most absurd. No doubt the griffin
    has been variously described, nevertheless it is generally agreed that
    the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> of this fabulous animal is either that of an eagle or that
    of a lion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many years ago, as I happened, in company with Dr. Liddon, to be
    passing the entrance of the Ashmolean Museum—the old original building
    by the Sheldonian Theatre—I asked him whether he had ever seen the
    Alfred Jewel. He had not, and he manifested some alacrity and we went
    in. It was naturally my part to act the showman, and I did it with
    a will, which was quickened by an interested motive. I set forth
    all my best exegesis of every part, except one—I left the animal’s
    head unnoticed. The old doubt about the nature of this head had been
    recently revived, and I lay in wait for testimony undesigned. I had
    the satisfaction of hearing my companion remark interrogatively, ‘That
    appears to be a boar’s head?’
  </p>

  <p>
    Between the wild boar and the helmet there existed a close and
    recognized association, as is well attested by the <cite>Beowulf</cite>, which
    is our chief voice from the heroic age of Teutonic antiquity. In the
    course of that poem there are no less than five passages in which
    this habitual association of ideas stands out prominently. The first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
    passage is where Beowulf and his companions have reached the Danish
    coast and stepped ashore and parleyed with the coast-warden, and
    obtained his approval of their visit and his offer of guidance to
    Hrothgar’s Court. As they set forth on their march inland, the poet
    notices the play of the sunlight glancing from the boar-figures on
    their helmets:

    Grendel, as being sung by the minstrel in Hrothgar’s hall. In the

    These closing lines recall the remarkable passage of Tacitus, where
    he says that the Æstii (Esthonians) venerate the mother of the gods,
    and that they wear figures of the wild boar as the emblem of her
    cult, and that this observance alone suffices without arms offensive
    or defensive to make her votary feel secure even in the midst of
    enemies<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mother of the gods may be identified, or at least proximately
    equated, with <span class="smcap">Frige</span>, the consort of Woden, whose name
    survives in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
    the sixth day of the week, Friday; <span class="smcap">Frige-dæg</span>. A survival of
    her cult is seen in the festive ceremony of the Boar’s Head, which is
    kept up in Queen’s College, Oxford, adding a mystic incident to the
    mirth of Christmas.

    Our fifth example occurs in a passage eminently characteristic of the
    heroic age, when the institutions of monarchy rested upon the personal
    devotion of the thane to the king. This relation is one of great
    historical consequence; it was to grow into the later institution
    of knighthood; it had been matured by that immemorial tradition of
    sacred confidence and fidelity between the war-chief and his companion
    in arms, which is signalized by Tacitus in words familiar to the
    modern historian. The passage which I am about to quote exhibits this
    devotion in concrete act. Beowulf, the hero of the poem, has returned
    successful from his adventure, and he is fulfilling his first duty by
    rendering a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> report to Hygelac his king. His speech is closing with
    mention of rich guerdon he had received from the king whom he had
    delivered, namely, Hrothgar, son of Halfdan; and then he produces the
    noblest of these prizes as a dutiful offering to his lord. This scene
    constitutes a frame to our last instance of the boar-figure as the
    most signal feature in a warrior’s headgear:

    In the evidence above given we see indications that this traditional
    choice of the wild boar for a crest was of high antiquity, and had
    its origin in a religious sentiment, and our fourth passage (1449
    ff.) certainly conveys the idea that the armourer who wrought at the
    furniture of the helmet did so with a mind still under the spell of
    the old persuasion that a mystic sanction clung to the figure of the
    wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> boar, and qualified it for its time-honoured post as guardian of
    the warrior’s head.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Alfred Jewel the Boar’s Head appears to discharge a double
    function: one subservient, as affording a base or pedestal to the
    frame of the sacred effigy; the other servile, as a socket for the
    shaft whereby the elaborate and composite design is to be fixed in its
    destined place.

    character, and it is the centre and focus of the whole. All the other
    parts are relative and subordinate to this, and the entire Jewel is in
    fact a setting and a shrine for this sacred object. We must endeavour
    to ascertain its intention and significance, but before attempting
    this interpretation we must consider the Enamel as a work of art.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this venerable relic, even if regarded only in its material aspect
    as an ingenious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> mechanical product, and as a specimen of a once
    flourishing art, is rare and curious to so high a degree as to confer
    rank upon any Museum (however otherwise rich) that is so fortunate as
    to possess it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind the Enamel, in the position of a backboard to a picture-frame,
    is a separate gold plate bearing a significant device which is
    certainly intended as a counterpart to the Figure of the obverse.
    From the relation observable between these two representations we may
    gather a constructive inference. Thus we have three subjects for our
    consideration in the present chapter, and it will be convenient to
    give to each of them a separate section by itself. Accordingly, the
    plan of this chapter will be as follows:—I. The Enamel as an artistic
    product; II. The inward signification of the enamelled Figure, and of
    the Engraving at the back of it; III. A Constructive Inference.

    <span class="smcap">The Enamel as an Artistic Product</span>
  </h3>

  <p>
    Of enamels we may say that they are a sort of paintings or
    embroideries;—only not made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> with liquid pigments nor with variegated
    threads, but with molten glass diversely tinted by means of metallic
    oxides<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. On the one hand they are the precursors of our painted
    windows, and on the other they are the parents of the famous works of
    the artists of Limoges. Of this artistic industry the Alfred Jewel
    preserves a specimen of the rarest kind. It belongs to the type which
    is designated <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cloisonnée</i>, because the outlines of the design have
    first been made by little slender barriers of gold which serve as
    fences between the colours. Into the compartments so enclosed the
    material of the enamel is deposited in the form of a vitreous paste,
    that is, glass ground to a fine powder, and mixed with the colouring
    material and moistened. So prepared, the work is passed into an oven,
    with a heat to melt the glass, but not the metal plate upon which the
    design has been laid. If the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
    process is successful, the work is substantially achieved when it
    comes out of the oven, and nothing remains to be done but the dressing
    and finishing of the surface. Of this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cloisonnée</i> type M. Labarte, in
    enumerating nine examples, as being the chief works of this kind now
    extant, gives to all of them the title ‘Byzantine.’

      The celebrated crown of gold, which goes by the name of the Iron
      Crown, is the oldest extant jewel that is enriched with enamel. It
      was given to the cathedral at Monza by Theodelinda, the Lombard
      queen, who died in 625<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.

      The enamels in the altar of St. Ambrose of Milan, executed in 835,
      must have been executed by Greek artists, who were numerous in Italy

      opaque white.

      “A jewel preserved in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. It was
      discovered in 1696 (<i>sic</i>), near the Abbey of Athelney, in which
      Alfred the Great took refuge when he was defeated by the Danes in
      878. Mr. Albert Way has given a description of it, with engravings
      of front and back, and in section (<cite>The Archæological Journal</cite>, vol.
      ii, p. 164). The inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEVYRCAN (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Alfred
      ordonna que je fusse fait</i>) which stands in the thickness of the
      piece, is thought to leave small room for doubt as to the origin
      which is attributed to it. The enamel of the obverse is executed
      by the process of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cloisonnage</i>; it represents a figure hard to
      characterize (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">il reproduit une figure dont il est difficile de
      déterminer le caractère</i>). The flesh portions are in whitish enamel;
      the colours employed in the drapery are pale green and ruddy brown
      semi-transparent; the ground is blue. The jewel terminates in the
      head of an animal, in golden filigree, with all the characteristics
      of the oriental style.
      <p>
      “Admitting that the inscription may apply to Alfred the Great,
      this jewel would not by itself be sufficient to prove that the art
      of enamelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> was practised in England in the ninth century. The
      inscription might have been engraved after the king had purchased it
      (possibly) of a merchant from the East.”

    <li>
      The enamels which environ the gold crown preserved in the treasury
      of St. Mark’s, at Venice. We see there a bust of the Emperor Leo the
      Philosopher (886–911), who was probably the donor of this votive
      crown, which was made to be suspended over an altar.
    </li>

    <li>
      The enamels on a chalice in the same treasury; it appears by the
      inscription to have been executed for an emperor who died in 944.

      The enamels on the reliquary of Limburg. This magnificent piece
      was executed before 976.
    </li>

    <li>
      The enamels upon eight gold plates which were found at Nyitra,
      in Hungary. Seven of them are in the Museum at Pesth. These eight
      plates unite to form a crown, one in front and one at back, and three
      on either side. Each has its enamelled picture. The front piece has
      a portrait of Constantinus Monomachus (1042). The pieces to right
      and left of this represent the Empresses Theodora and Zoe; the next
      two on either side represent actresses; the third on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span> either side
      contains an allegorical figure of a woman, the one being Humility,
      with hands crossed in front, the other Truth, bearing a cross. The
      eighth, which is the hindmost, is circular, and represents St.
      Andrew<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      The enamels which decorate the royal crown of Hungary, which was
      sent as a present to Geysa I, king of Hungary, who died in 1077.
    </li>

  <p>
    In this list the famous ‘iron’ crown of Monza holds the first place,
    being, in fact, an ample golden fillet richly decorated with enamels,
    and containing within it a narrow hoop of iron, which is reputed to
    have been made of a nail from the Cross.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fourth place in this catalogue is assigned by M. Labarte to the
    Alfred Jewel, and by this classification it is referred to a Byzantine
    source. But as it is plain from the matter as well as the manner of
    his description that his acquaintance with the Jewel is second-hand,
    we pass over this local element, while we accept his classification so
    far as it refers to structural affinities.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the spring of 1839, during some excavations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> in Thames Street,
    was discovered a fibula which happily passed straightway into the
    hands of Mr. Roach Smith, and he wrote a memoir upon it which may
    be seen in the <cite>Archæologia</cite> for 1840, accompanied with a splendid
    illustration in colour and gold. It contains a bust in cloison-work
    enamel, and invites comparison with our Jewel more than any of those
    in the above list, probably more than any other extant specimen. It
    is now in the British Museum. Both the figure and the filigree are
    of superior workmanship to the Alfred Jewel, as if it were a later
    and more refined product of the same school. A French critic calls it
    Byzantine, and assigns it to the eleventh century<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    So far about other extant specimens of enamel <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cloisonnée</i>. This
    species of enamel rises like an island out of the broad level of the
    enamel <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">champlevée</i>, in which the plate was prepared for the vitreous
    deposit by scooping the pattern upon it. To this common method belong
    the older and more rudimentary enamels of the British horse-gear,
    correctly described by Philostratus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> who will be quoted below. To
    this belong also the late enamels, for which during the thirteenth
    century Limoges was famous.
  </p>

  <p>
    The history of the art of enamelling is very imperfectly known, and
    the paucity of extant specimens makes the investigation the more
    difficult. The canvas upon which these pictures were laid consisted of
    plates of the precious metals, the smaller works being laid upon gold
    or silver, the larger on copper. As a natural consequence it happened
    that as soon as they were antiquated or had served their turn, they
    were lightly cast into the melting-pot, save where they were protected
    by some peculiar veneration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hence it has come to pass that a favourite art of the Dark and Middle
    Ages, which we have reason to believe was for centuries very prolific
    (until it was superseded by the increased vigour of painting and
    sculpture in the fourteenth century), is now represented by a few
    specimens only, and its history is hard to retrace. I shall make no
    attempt to supply this want, and shall only rehearse a few interesting
    facts which the present investigation has brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span> to my knowledge.
    Origins I leave to specialists: but this I may say, that such evidence
    as the present enquiry has brought within the circle of my observation
    seems to suggest a Keltic source for the Enamel in our Jewel.
  </p>

  <p>
    The earliest mention of enamel to which we can confidently point is
    found in the book of Philostratus entitled <cite>Pictures</cite> (Icones,
    <i class="roman" xml:lang="el" lang="el">Εἰκόνες</i>). This author was a Greek rhetorician and connoisseur in
    Art, who came to Rome (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 200) in the reign of Severus,
    attracted by the Court of Julia Domna, who (in the words of Gibbon)
    was the patroness of every art and the friend of every man of genius.
    In his <cite>Icones</cite> he makes pictures the text of his elegant and
    fashionable discourse. Whether his pictures were real or imaginary
    is a matter of no consequence to our present purpose. The picture
    in which we are interested is one that represents a Meet for a
    Boar-hunt. The writer comments upon the well-equipped company, the
    horses and their riders, in the splendour of their get-up for the
    sport, drawing special attention to the curiosity and costliness of
    their horse-trappings. Their bits are silvern, and their head-stalls
    are decorated with gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> and enamelled colours. For the production of
    these colours it is said that ‘the barbarians who dwell in the ocean
    do smelt them upon heated copper, and that in cooling they do set and
    harden and keep the design<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.’
  </p>

  <p>
    It has been questioned who are meant by the barbarians in the ocean.
    Modern French writers have generally applied it to the Gauls; but
    Olearius, the editor of Philostratus (1709), understood the Keltic
    peoples; and certainly the expression appears more applicable to the
    British Isles than to Gaul. Moreover, it is in Britain, and not in
    Gaul, that enamelled horse-trappings have been found. Some of these
    may be seen in the Ashmolean, and more in the British Museum.
  </p>

  <p>
    ‘The antiquities discovered at Stanwick in Yorkshire, Polden Hill in
    Somersetshire, Saham Toney in Norfolk, Westhall in Suffolk, and at
    Middleby in Annandale, Scotland, which are all of Celtic workmanship,
    consist principally of bits and portions of horse-furniture of various
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>kinds which have preserved, in many cases, the enamel with which they
    were decorated<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.’
  </p>

  <p>
    The Romans or Romanized populations continued the practice of this
    art, and from the evidence of the finds that occur from time to time
    it appears probable that some of the finest specimens were made in
    Britain. A large flat plate, representing an altar, which was found
    in London and is now in the British Museum, has all the appearance
    of being unfinished. A curious cup, which was found at Rudge in
    Wiltshire, has round it the names of five of the towns on the Roman
    Wall. And this specimen appears, by peculiarities of workmanship, to
    be nearly related to the beautiful vase which was found in a tumulus
    on the Bartlow Hills, in Essex, where it seems to have been deposited
    after the time of Hadrian. And if the Saxon invasions of the fifth
    and sixth centuries did, as it is thought, obliterate all traces of
    this art in the other parts of the west, this could only have had the
    effect of making the practice of it peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> to Ireland; and the
    Irish were not a stay-at-home race, neither did they hide their gifts
    from other people.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a Keltic aspect in the enamelled designs which was remarked
    by Franks, and which may have accompanied the tradition of this art
    even when it passed out of Keltic hands<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, all the indications which this enquiry has brought to my
    notice concerning the technical history of our Enamel do seem to
    localize it in the British Isles. At a later stage of this chapter
    we shall be met by evidence of a different kind, tending in the same
    direction.

  <h3>
    II<br />
    <span class="smcap">
      The Inward Signification of the Figure, and of the Engraving at the back of it
    </span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    About the signification of this Figure the conjectures have been
    diverse, but they have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>all agreed in recognizing the two sceptres as
    the characterizing attribute. Hickes, in his first interpretation,
    thought that the <i>icuncula</i> represented the glorified Saviour with a
    lily sceptre in either hand, denoting his twofold realm of heaven and
    earth: or else the pontiff of Rome as his vicegerent wielding both
    the temporal and the spiritual power. Afterwards, however, when he
    had read in pseudo-Ingulph the story of St. Cuthbert’s appearance to
    Alfred, and had contemplated in the Lichfield Book the figure of St.
    Luke (seemingly, but not really two-sceptered), he was moved to think
    that the <i>icuncula</i> represented a saint, and was, perhaps, meant for
    St. Cuthbert<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think Hickes was right in his first interpretation, and especially
    in the second member of his alternative, wherein he referred it to the
    pope. In the ninth century the thought of Christ was easily blended
    with that of his vicegerent upon earth: and it is plain that the
    Figure is arrayed in precisely those insignia which best represent the
    dominant thought of the papacy at that epoch. The two sceptres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> aptly
    symbolize the claim and aspiration of the Western hierarchy during
    those very years which Alfred spent in Rome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leo IV, the pontiff who welcomed the princely boy to Rome, had
    already, as the organizer of victory over the Saracens, done much to
    prepare the exaltation of the Roman See. Many causes conspired to
    the same result. This was just the moment when the famous Decretals
    were ready to start upon their triumphant career. A first display of
    their working was seen in 858, when the novel solemnity of coronation
    was added to the consecration of Nicholas I. And, as I apprehend the
    course of events, this falls within the period of Alfred’s sojourn at Rome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not long after this the surprizing spectacle was seen of the pope on
    horseback, and the emperor on foot walking by his side and holding his
    bridle as he rode. This pontiff gave commands to kings and ruled over
    them as lord of the whole world; and he actually realized his ambition
    of making all secular power subject to the papacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    He claimed the subjection of all national churches to the bishop of
    Rome. He decreed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> in 866, that no archbishop might be enthroned or
    might consecrate the eucharist, until he had received the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pallium</i>
    from the Roman pontiff.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was much in the conditions of the time and in his own experience
    to cause Alfred to view these things wholly on their favourable side.
    The enamelled head is probably not meant for a portrait of Leo IV or
    any particular pope, but we can hardly be mistaken if we interpret it
    as a symbolical figure to represent the papal authority as the vicar
    and vicegerent of Christ.
  </p>

  <p>
    And if this be a true solution of the problematical <em>icuncula</em>, there
    is yet something more which we naturally desire to know. We naturally
    inquire about the composition of the symbol, of what elements is it
    made up, and from what source did the suggestion come?

    <div class="caption">ILLUMINATION FROM THE ‘BOOK OF KELLS.’</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    In the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, is preserved a very famous
    book, known as the <cite>Book of Kells</cite>, a monument of Irish learning and
    art in that period when Ireland most justly earned the glorious title
    of ‘Insula Sanctorum.’ One of the full-page illuminations which adorn
    that book represents a scene of the Temptation, in which Jesus is on
    the pinnacle and Satan is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
    near. Such is the action represented: but besides the action the same
    picture conveys also a reflection or comment upon the action. Lower
    down, and more in the body of the building, there is a window at which
    is seen a majestic personage holding a sceptre in either hand, which
    leans and rests on either shoulder. At first sight the effect is
    quaint, bizarre, and puzzling; but a little attention makes all plain.
    It becomes clear that a contrast is intended between the humiliation
    and the triumph of the Christ; and perhaps also, by the association
    of ideas which the last two verses of St. Matthew’s Gospel have made
    familiar, to suggest the duty (zealously discharged by the early Irish
    Church) of missionary devotion. No one who has given time and thought
    to this picture can doubt that the two-sceptered figure is Christ.
    Here is no question of the pontiff of Rome. In the seventh century,
    to which the <cite>Book of Kells</cite> is assigned, the papal claims were not
    admitted, much less glorified, by those of the Scotian rite. Therefore
    the interpretation of that Irish picture is quite simple, and it
    represents the glorified Christ inhabiting his temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> and looking out
    over his Church as Lord of heaven and earth<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though we know only of a single extant copy of this picture, we may
    confidently assume that among the manifold activities of the monks and
    hermits and missionaries and pilgrims from Ireland it was multiplied
    and disseminated. It is (I think) impossible to compare our Figure
    of the ninth century with that of the seventh, without coming to the
    conclusion that the one is a descendant of the other. We need not be
    incredulous about the chance of Alfred’s being acquainted with Irish
    iconography. The narrative in the Chronicle
    (<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/a-t.jpg" alt="Ā" width="51" height="51" />.</span> 891) of
    three Irish exiles who found their way to king Alfred, reflects a
    valuable light on his kindly relations with the learned and pious from
    the sister island. This connexion was neither new nor immature. When
    they found themselves ashore on the coast of Cornwall they set out ‘at
    once’—such is the effect of <span class="smcap">sona</span>—for king Alfred<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, the Irish picture furnishes a welcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> light upon an obscure
    detail of our enamelled Figure. How are the heads of the sceptres to
    be explained? Some have taken them for palms, and others for lilies,
    but the Irish drawing shows them rather as plumes. And this finds
    support in a singular passage of Bede’s <cite>Ecclesiastical History</cite>.
    Speaking of Oswald the Bretwalda, Bede describes him as a prince who
    carefully upheld his imperial dignity, insomuch that, not only when
    he rode through his provinces did his standard go before him, but
    even when he walked forth in the streets he was always preceded by
    an apparitor bearing the Tufa, which (he adds) was in the vernacular
    called Tuuf. We learn from Du Cange that the Tufa was a wand with a
    head of plumes, and this is what we see in the sceptres of the Irish
    drawing. Sir Francis Palgrave divined that the Saxon Bretwaldadom had
    inherited this emblem of authority from the provincial dignitaries of
    the empire.
  </p>

  <p>
    From these data the natural conclusion is that the Figure in this
    Jewel was derived from an Irish, and not from an Oriental, nor from
    any continental source. It was taken from an Irish symbolical drawing
    of Christ triumphant and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> reigning over his Church, and it was adapted
    by the king in a sense which his experience had made real and concrete
    and practical. As Chaucer was called ‘grand translateur,’ so we may
    call Alfred a grand adapter. Whoever has been drawn in to study both
    Alfred and Dante may have observed this in common to the two, that
    what they borrow they transfigure, their touch imparts to it the
    colour of their mind. King Alfred in early youth was tied by every
    thread of religious conviction and political interest and personal
    sentiment to the See of Rome, and he meant this Jewel to enshrine
    the frontispiece of his profession and the ensign of his creed
    ecclesiastical, political, and personal.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the close of the former section I said that the conclusion there
    arrived at would be confirmed by another kind of evidence in the
    sequel. Up to that point the argument had run upon the technical
    aspects of our enamelled Figure, and these had seemed to indicate the
    British Isles as its native region. Since that stage our argument has
    turned upon the conception and pedigree of the device; and here again
    we find that an insular rather than a foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> source is indicated.
    Further evidence, pointing in the same direction, will be advanced
    before the close of the present chapter<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    At the back of this Enamel there is a gold plate which serves the
    same purpose as a backboard to a picture, and it is secured by an
    overlapping undulating border of gold. In the Minster Lovel jewel this
    member consists of a blank gold plate, but in the Alfred Jewel this
    surface is occupied with an engraving which is certainly allegorical.
    At first sight it seems to be no more than a decorated pattern made
    upon the idea of a tree with branches and blossoms and fruit<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. But
    upon closer inspection this tree appears to be a sword with its point
    buried in a human heart, and when this is discovered it becomes plain
    that the branches and blossoms must be allegorical.

  <p>
    A sword with its point planted in a human heart may mean compunction
    for sin and mortification of the natural man; it may also mean
    resignation in adversity to the overruling providence of God. Such a
    disposition of mind is productive of flowers and fruit, that is, of
    conduct which is beautiful and profitable, and (on great occasions)
    of action which is heroic. This mode of symbolical expression may be
    seen in the figure of St. Luke in St. Chad’s Book at Lichfield. The
    Evangelist holds in his right hand a pen, the feathery part of which
    branches out into flowers and fruit, to signify the fruitful nature of
    the writings of St. Luke<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    These are the obvious meanings of such a symbolical device, and this
    being so, it plainly results that the Figure and its back-plate are
    united by correlation of thought. The enamelled Figure is the symbol
    of religion in its ecclesiastical and political aspect; the engraved
    plate represents the inward disposition of the heart, the root and
    fount of personal religion. The former is of the nature of a public
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>profession, and as such is openly displayed to view; the latter is
    reserved, out of sight, facing the wall.

  <h3>
    III<br />
    <span class="smcap">A Constructive Inference</span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    And this raises a consideration to which I invite careful attention.
    These two pictures, the one enamelled, the other engraved, are
    complementary the one to the other; they are two parts of one design,
    and as such they combine to declare the unity of thought which
    locks together the composition and fabric of this Jewel into one
    constructive whole. And this observation, once verified and clearly
    apprehended, must henceforth exclude the theory of Sir Francis
    Palgrave which explained this Jewel as being derived from two diverse
    sources in the following manner:—
  </p>

  <p>
    ‘Alfred’s Jewel, in the mechanical workmanship of the metallic
    portion, offers a close resemblance to the Icelandic ornaments, now
    made in the island, where the mode has probably continued by usage
    from the most remote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> periods. The enamel within, on the other hand,
    resembles some ornaments of the Carlovingian era now existing on the
    continent, which have been generally considered as Oriental. The head
    at the extremity of the ornament is extremely like what is found in
    those architectural ornaments usually called Saxon, e. g. the porch of
    St. Margaret’s at York. Whether St. Neot be the personage represented
    in the enamel I rather doubt; and I think it possible that the enamel
    itself was brought from the continent, and that the setting only was
    made in England. This would reconcile the two styles of workmanship;
    the metallic portion is unquestionably Anglo-Saxon, the enamel may be
    supposed to be from another country. But altogether it is one of the
    most curious relics of the kind; and no one, taking all the points of
    evidence together, can reasonably doubt but that it did belong to king
    Alfred.’
  </p>

  <p>
    This is copied from the Ashmolean Catalogue, 1836 (p. 138), the work
    of Mr. Philip Duncan, or rather perhaps of the two brothers, John and
    Philip Duncan, both Fellows of New College, and successively Keepers
    of the Ashmolean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> Museum, men famous in their generation for their
    zeal in promoting all that was good and generous and beautiful; and
    graced, both of them, with a strong and manly beauty worthy to support
    the nobility of their character and set it forth to the best advantage.
  </p>

  <p>
    I take the above to be an extract from a letter to one of the brothers
    in answer to enquiries addressed to Sir Francis Palgrave, asking
    his opinion about the Jewel, and especially whether he thought the
    evidence warranted the conclusion that it had really belonged to the
    great king of Wessex. The answer has a peculiar value, because of
    the firm judgement it supplies upon the main problem. The deliberate
    opinion of the most competent authority of the time upon this point
    is of permanent value. Of a different nature is the other part of his
    answer, in which he embarked upon a bold antiquarian diagnosis, and
    broached his dualistic theory. This solution was accepted at the time
    as furnishing a solid basis for the interpretation of the Jewel, and
    it has held its ground ever since.
  </p>

  <p>
    This new hypothesis gave satisfaction on three grounds: first, in
    that it accounted for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> quaintness of the Figure as being probably
    Byzantine or Oriental; secondly, in that it lightened the burden of
    credit demanded for our insular jewellers of the ninth century; and
    thirdly, because it squared so well with the accredited fact that
    Alfred did receive presents from foreign potentates. On all these
    grounds the dual hypothesis of Sir Francis Palgrave gave general
    satisfaction and seemed to be absolutely final.
  </p>

  <p>
    For myself, I adopted it as the pivot of my interpretation, and as
    such I used it in the last lecture I gave on the subject, which was
    in May, 1899. But now at length, by the wider and more searching
    investigation which has been required in the preparation of this
    Essay, I have satisfied myself that all the parts of this composite
    work are bound together by a unity of thought which manifests the
    effort of a single mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    All available testimony indicates that this was none other than the
    mind of king Alfred. In support of this broad assertion I will here
    bring forward a new illustration from the original writings of the
    king. When he had translated the <cite>Pastoral Care</cite> he furnished it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
    a prologue and an epilogue, both in verse: the prologue is given
    above, in the second of these chapters; the epilogue is quoted here.
    It illustrates his love of figure and symbol, and his aptness for the
    development of a train of allegorical thought:

    The diction of alliterative poetry has fallen out of use, and
    consequently this illustration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
    must labour under the disadvantage of
    being in a form unfamiliar to the general reader. Nevertheless, with
    a little attention, the essential point will become plain. The royal
    translator had been refreshed and invigorated with the lucid stream
    of Gregory’s discourse, and at the moment of parting with a beloved
    task he sought to relieve his full-fraught soul with a grateful
    burst of eulogy. Out of all the topics that were appropriate to the
    occasion he chose the perennial water of life promised at the well of
    Samaria, and upon this noble theme he expatiated with a fertility of
    invention which makes it the easier for us to attribute to him the
    rich symbolism of the Alfred Jewel.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    And now to gather up the results of this chapter. We have found more
    than one reason to think that our Enamel was an insular, and not a
    continental product. This conclusion was reached by two different
    paths, first when we were tracing the technical history of the
    fabrication, and again when we were seeking the spiritual meaning of
    the design; by these two widely different lines of evidence we were
    led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> severally and independently to infer a British rather than a
    foreign origin for the Figure<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This inference was further confirmed by a third evidential process,
    arising out of the sympathy of meaning which appears to unite the
    enamelled Figure with the engraved device upon its back-plate. This
    led us to question the long-established doctrine of duality of origin
    which rested upon the authority of Sir Francis Palgrave, and to infer
    that the whole composition of the Jewel had been projected and devised
    by a single mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, we found reason to think that all these features harmonized
    well with the mind and character of a person with whose name the Jewel
    is already connected by the Epigraph; and if anything was yet wanting
    to complete the identification of that person, it seems to be supplied
    by certain traces of inward affinity between the symbolism of the
    Jewel and that of the epilogue to the translation of the <cite>Pastoral
    Care</cite>, one of the surest monuments of the mind of king <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>.

      <span class="medium">ALFRED IN SOMERSET BEYOND PEDRIDA</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">When</span> we have described the form and symbolism of the Alfred Jewel, and
    reviewed the various interpretations which it has evoked, and when we
    have moreover analyzed its design and considered each several feature,
    we have not as yet exhausted the matter of our theme. An important
    part of the problem remains to be discussed, and that is the place
    of its discovery, the how and the why of its deposit there, and the
    possibility of light to be derived from the historical associations
    of the locality. It was found near the Isle of Athelney. This looks
    like a piece of circumstantial evidence tending to identify the Alfred
    named in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
    Epigraph, and to associate the Jewel with the chief and central
    episode in the career of our national hero. The momentous crisis which
    is thus reflected in the Jewel seems to open a wider view, and to
    demand some enlargement of this Essay, so as to embrace a glimpse of
    that eventful story.

  </div>

  <p>
    Of all this we now, after the lapse of a thousand years, speak as
    men who know the sequel, and (because we do know the sequel) it is
    the harder for us to appreciate the intensity of that crisis. We are
    helped by the occurrence of an opportune discovery. Just when our
    nation was beginning to be ripe for historical reflection and capable
    of entering into the struggles of our remote forefathers, there was
    ‘dug up’ in the locality where Alfred took refuge in the year 878, a
    personal ornament bearing his name in impressive characters. It is to
    us now as if the king himself had but recently passed that way under
    such stress of circumstances as constrained him to hide his royal
    insignia, and as if we somehow by this chance were brought nearer to
    the burden of his lot, and were made sharers not only in the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> fruits
    of his triumph, but also in the toil and the joy of his achievement.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    By the sudden surprize with which the Danes had broken the peace and
    come upon him at Chippenham in the dead of winter, they had almost
    fulfilled their design and taken him captive. But he had fled, and
    they had Wessex at will, and were proceeding to divide and occupy the
    land. The king, with a few companions, had escaped into Selwood, and
    thence by wood and by fen, like hunted creatures, they eluded pursuit,
    but were never secure until they had passed beyond Pedrida.
  </p>

  <p>
    What were his reflections on finding himself suddenly an outcast in
    the winter, a fugitive in the wild? He had experienced hair-breadth
    escapes, but none like this! He had trusted Guthrum’s oath, had
    thought him in earnest this time! And even now he was loth to charge
    this last perfidy upon him. No! this trick was not his, it came from
    those buccaneers in the Severn Sea. Mad at the defeat of last summer’s
    combined scheme, which they had come from far north to support, they
    had forced Guthrum’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
    hand, and compelled him to join them in this
    winter raid. And they would not stop there! Finding that he had
    given them the slip, they would certainly be down upon some part of
    the coast of Somerset or of Devon, and preparations must be made to
    receive them. Odda will surely be stirring: he is safe to be on the
    alert! I must find out what he is doing, and we must work on a plan;
    he in Devon, and I in Somerset!
  </p>

  <p>
    It was now twelve years since he had come to the front, and had taken
    his stand by the side of his brother Æthered. The moment when he had
    begun to share in public affairs had coincided with a great change in
    the situation. That was the time when the invaders acquired a footing
    in East Anglia: they made there a centre of operations from which they
    went out and to which they came in—it had become the head quarters
    of an invading host which manifested a settled design of conquest.
    Previously the incursions of the Northmen had been desultory, but from
    that time they had become methodical. This change had coincided with
    the death of Æthelbriht in 866, and the accession of Æthered.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> In the following year had
    died Alhstan, that vigilant patriot, the old warlike bishop of Sherborne.
  </p>

  <p>
    Æthered and I were the two youngest of the family, and our relations
    had been peculiarly close. Before we were united by public cares, we
    had been partners in our private concerns. Our several estates had
    been kept in one and worked in common, under agreed conditions, so
    that they had remained undivided. Our names had been coupled together
    by the common voice of the nation. The style was ever thus:—<span class="smcap">Æþered
    cyning and Ælfred his broþur.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    Oh what a fearful time it was for <span class="smcap">Angelcynn</span>, that five years
    of Æthered’s reign! Northumbria, that old imperial kingdom, was
    crushed; Mercia reduced to make a peace with the heathen, which was
    the best we could effect by marching in force to Nottingham to support
    Burgred and Æthelswith! And, worst of all, the East Angles defeated in
    battle, the good king Edmund slain (he fought like a hero, and died
    like a martyr); the land conquered, possessed, and turned from an
    Anglian into a Danish kingdom!
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

  <p>
    It was our turn next. All was at length ripe for the subjugation of
    Wessex, and on this aim they brought all their strength to bear. We
    made a gallant stand at Ashdown against overwhelming odds; we slew
    their kings and jarls, and made their practised braves fly before
    the rustic militia of Ecgberht. Eight pitched battles in that year,
    besides smaller fights without number. But Æthered died at Easter.
    Rightly the people revere him as a saint. So I was left to continue
    the struggle single-handed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since then they have established themselves in the possession of
    London, and they have banished Burgred and set up for king in Mercia
    a tool of their own; also Halfdan has abolished the kingdom of
    Northumbria and partitioned the land. And amidst all this, what a
    destruction of religious houses, seats of piety and learning and
    education—Lindisfarne, Wearmouth, Jarrow, York, Ripon, Bardney, Ely,
    Crowland, Medeshamstead, and many others.
  </p>

  <p>
    They have destroyed the powers of Northumbria and Mercia; but there
    they had a point in their favour which is against them here. The Welsh
    at the back of those nations were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
    always ready to co-operate with
    the invader, but that is not so here in the west. The Cornish have
    never made common cause with the heathen since the battle of Hingston
    Down, in which that coalition was quashed by Ecgberht. And we have a
    still better guarantee in the constant policy of Wessex ever since the
    days of Ina and Aldhelm. The territorial quarrel was then appeased,
    and the religious difference too. The West Welsh were conquered, but
    they were never wantonly humiliated, no man was ejected from his own.
    They appreciated the respect and even honour that was shown to their
    favourite church of Glastonbury. Therefore I have good hope of the
    support of the men of Somerset.
  </p>

  <p>
    True, we have to count upon the hostility of the Welsh on the opposite
    shore of the Severn Sea, where the Danish fleets find harbour and
    all friendly countenance. Still, that is not quite the same thing
    as having an active enemy behind your back upon the same stretch of
    territory. Here in this west country the people differ only in degrees
    of allegiance, none are actively hostile. This is the weak point in
    the position of the invaders. This is the one little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
    bit of advantage that still remains to us. I must improve it to the utmost!
  </p>

  <p>
    But first of all we must provide against a sudden descent on the
    coast. For the last two years events have succeeded one another at a
    quickened pace: surprize on surprize! There, under the opposite coast,
    lies a heathen fleet, ready to be down upon us without notice! The
    coast-wardens must be kept up to the mark, and I not to be seen in it!
  </p>

  <p>
    The mobility of these troopers defies calculation! How unexpected and
    startling was that occupation of Wareham last autumn! How daringly
    defiant of gods and men that breach of their most sacred oath! When by
    that perjury they had lulled our mistrust, they made a sudden rush for
    Exeter! Perfidy is part of their tactics. How wonderful, how divinely
    providential, that storm off Swanage, which wrecked the perfidious
    plan! And now, not to be baulked, they pounce upon Chippenham in time
    of truce and in mid-winter, thinking to capture me! How great in war
    is the unexpected! Without perfidy, I too must learn to meditate
    surprize; I must contrive how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
    distract their calculations, and strike where least expected.
  </p>

  <p>
    With some such a strain of thought as this (if I have followed him
    aright) now ruminated the undaunted king, in whom thought was the
    spring of action. Moreover, he reasoned thus with himself: ‘So long
    as winter lasts, they cannot follow me with the host by the way that
    I have come, but if they learn my whereabouts, they may easily find
    adventurers who would undertake to kill me. Wherefore I must not make
    myself too freely known, but proceed cautiously, and make proof of men
    before I trust myself to them. To most I must appear like some mounted
    yeoman hunter who follows the high deer that abound in the forests
    about these hills. And as for this sacred toy, this personal enigma,
    this Jewel of ceremony, which many eyes have beheld, I must no longer
    carry it about me, lest peradventure it make me known unawares. I will
    bury it in some convenient spot!’
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    The western boundary of Wessex had for centuries been the Great Wood
    of which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
    ancient name still survives as a specific element in the
    historic designation of Frome Selwood.
  </p>

  <p>
    This great wood was also called Wealwudu, a very natural and
    appropriate name, because it had long been the barrier between the
    Saxon and the Welsh populations. Here lies the most fitting scene for
    the story of Denewulf. In the time when the king was a fugitive, he
    found this man keeping swine in the forest, and he discovered in him
    a great natural capacity and aptness for good, and after his return
    to power he educated Denewulf, and made him bishop of Winchester.
    This story does not run on all fours, because according to the best
    authorities Denewulf became bishop of Winchester in 879, and if he was
    keeping swine in 878, being already of mature age, it smacks rather
    of hagiology than of history. But it may be that the marvel has been
    enhanced in transmission; or if we choose the lowest estimate and call
    it mere fiction, still it is worth while observing what manner of
    stories were invented about king Alfred.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind this barrier the Danes had never been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
    able to get a footing.
    As if aware how greatly this was needed for the success of their
    designs upon Wessex, they had made several attempts. Two great efforts
    which imply this aim were made at the end of the reign of Ecgberht.
    The force of thirty-five ships which that king repelled at Charmouth,
    on the coast of Dorset, seems to indicate something more than merely a
    plundering incursion.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 835, a great naval armament (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">micel sciphere</i>) came to the Cornish
    coast and were joined by the West Welsh, and they gathered in force
    at Hingston Down, where they probably intended to fortify themselves;
    when Ecgberht appeared with an army, and dispersed them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next recorded attempt of the kind was in the year 845, in the
    reign of Æthelwulf, when the Wicengas entered the mouth of the Parret,
    and were met by the posse comitatus of the two shires, Somerset and
    Dorset, under their two ealdormen, and Alhstan the warlike bishop of
    Sherborne.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only in the very last year (877) their land-force had, by a perfidious
    surprize, seized Exeter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
    acting in concert with a fleet of one
    hundred and twenty ships, which were to sail up the Exe and co-operate
    with them—but they were wrecked in a storm off Swanage<a id="FNanchor_30"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. This
    disaster, combined with the promptitude of the king in assault, had
    compelled them to capitulate, and had dislodged them from Exeter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the same nature and motive was the attempt of this spring on the
    coast of Devon at a place which Asser calls Cynwit, with a force of
    twenty-three ships, which were wintering on the opposite coast of the
    Severn Sea. The repulse was complete and the blow decisive, but the
    name of the English leader is not given by the contemporary annalist.
    A hundred and twenty years later, Ethelwerd calls him Odda the
    ealdorman of Devonshire. The reticence of the Chronicle suggests that
    this achievement was conducted by Alfred while he was keeping
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>in the
    background, lest the place of his retreat should become known.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    Gradually and by the spontaneous action of natural causes, the western
    barrier of the Saxon was moved from the line of Selwood to the fenland
    of Pedrida. This barrier was deeper bedded in the soil, was harder
    to pass, and has left behind it memories more indelible. The first
    explicit notice of this virtual transfer of the western boundary meets
    us seventeen years later than the epoch with which we are now engaged,
    and it may be worth while to go so far out of our way in order the
    better to realize the import of Pedrida.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the last decade of Alfred’s reign, when he was in the agony of that
    supreme crisis which tested the value of his institutions, a great
    muster of force was called for, and the extent of the contributing
    area is sketched by the annalist as matter of amazement. ‘There
    gathered Æthered aldorman and Æthelm aldorman and Æthelnoth aldorman,
    and the king’s Thanes who were then at home in the fortifications,
    from every garrison east of Pedrida<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
    (whether west of Selwood or
    east), likewise also north of Thames and west of Severn:—moreover some
    part of the Welsh nation<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.’
  </p>

  <p>
    Here we mark the startling novelty that the Welsh in 894 are seen
    aiding the Saxon against the Dane; and we can hardly forgo a passing
    cry of wonder and pleasure at this signal token of the imperial
    success of Alfred’s policy. But our present concern is with the
    recognition of Pedrida as the westernmost limit of Wessex proper
    instead of Selwood, and the implication that the change was recent.
    We see that Selwoodshire (as the intervening district was popularly
    called) was by 894 quite assimilated and included in the military
    administration of Wessex, but that beyond Pedrida some other rule was
    operative at that time. Such a fact reflects back an illustrative
    light upon the year 878, and helps us to estimate the situation of
    Alfred when he was in Somerset beyond Pedrida.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

  <p>
    The political division here indicated has left traces which may
    still be recognized, particularly in the dialect and in folk-lore. Of
    the dialect we have a remarkable monument in Mr. Elworthy’s works,
    <cite>The Dialect of West Somerset</cite>, and his <cite>West Somerset Word-Book</cite>.
    Especially to be noted is the ‘u’ of the West Country, which is
    radically one with the Welsh ‘u’ and with the French ‘u,’ while at
    the same time it has a very distinct local character of its own.
    Every Englishman who is conversant with the French language knows how
    hard it is to acquire the utterance of the French ‘u’ after the age
    of infancy. A like strangeness is experienced by English people born
    east of Pedrida, when they attempt to reproduce the western ‘u.’ In
    fact, this vowel-sound is Keltic; it is a legacy from our British
    predecessors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not that this British ‘u’ is absolutely confined to the western
    promontory: it may be occasionally heard in other parts of the country
    by a cultivated and observant ear. Mr. Mayhew once told me that he had
    heard it in the Corn Market at Oxford. But though not confined to the
    lands west of Pedrida, it is in a peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
    manner concentrated there.
    It is chiefly in Devonshire that this peculiar vowel has wakened wider
    attention, but this is simply because that county has been the most
    frequented as a place of holiday resort.
  </p>

  <p>
    The so-called Devonian ‘u’ and its contiguous sounds have been
    described many times from first to last, but it has been mostly
    in that perfunctory vein which contents the summer tourist. It is
    rare to catch such a plain and solid illustration as the following,
    which is quoted from the preface to Mr. Elworthy’s <cite>West Somerset
    Word-Book</cite>:—‘I was a passive listener at Brandon’s while a bonnet was
    being discussed, and when making the payment ventured to remark to the
    young lady, “You must have been a long time in London.” “Oh yes, ten
    years; but why do you ask?” “Only for information,” said I. “And did
    you come straight from Teignmouth?” With much surprise at my supposing
    she came from Devonshire, she said at length that she was a native
    of Newton Abbott. I could not pretend to define the precise quality
    of her <i>two</i>, but it was only in that one word that I recognized her
    locality.’
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

  <p>
    If the vocabulary of this dialect were minutely examined by a
    competent Welsh scholar, some British words might be detected. Among
    those which would deserve early attention are <i>plum</i> (soft, as a bed),
    <i>pilm</i> or <i>pillum</i> (dust), <i>welt</i> (to beat, thrash).
  </p>

  <p>
    Another local characteristic of the West Welsh promontory is this,
    that it is the peculiar haunt of a race of whimsical or mischievous
    sprites called Piskies or Pixies. In South Devon and Cornwall any one
    whose conduct is strange and unaccountable is said to be pisky-led.
    This is a branch of the numerous kindred of that versatile Puck, whose
    memory is kept fresh by the Midsummer Night’s Dream. In an Anglo-Saxon
    perambulation of land at Weston by Bath, we meet with a Pucan Wyl,
    Puck’s Well<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.
    The <cite>English Dialect Dictionary</cite> preserves the name
    of Aw-Puck for Will-o’-the-Wisp or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ignis fatuus</i>, a compound which
    imports that he is the most dangerous of the species. This name was
    current in Worcestershire, but is now obsolete
    <a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

  <p>
    These are the more obvious extant traces of the long isolation of
    the trans-Pedridan world: others there are which have attracted
    inquiry, such as peculiar customs, implements, songs and song-tunes,
    which latter have been investigated by Dr. Bussell and the Rev. S.
    Baring-Gould.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    The Somerset to which Alfred retired was widely unlike the Somerset
    of to-day. In this respect three points may be taken: (1) Differences
    in the distribution of land and water; (2) differences in the trees
    and woods and game; (3) differences in the political aspect of the
    population.
  </p>

  <p>
    1. West Somerset was separated from East Somerset by wide inland
    waters: the beds of the Brue and Parret were lakes in the winter, and
    only passable in summer to those who knew the ground. Pedrida was
    regarded as a natural limit, like the sea itself, dividing nations;
    it was spoken of in like phraseology. Thus we read in 658 how Cenwalh

  <p>
    The cause of that expanse of water and large area of fenland happened
    far back beyond historical chronology, and we can only date it by
    using the geological method of reckoning time. Far back in the
    sub-glacial era a subsidence of the land took place which affected
    the coast of Somerset and North Devon. Proof of this is found in a
    submarine forest extending along the south coast of the Severn Sea,
    which has long been known. ‘That portion of it visible at Porlock
    was described in 1839 by Sir Henry de la Beche, and more recently by
    Mr. Godwin Austen in an essay read before the Geological Society in
    1865<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.’
  </p>

  <p>
    Subsequently the Rev. H. H. Winwood and Professor Boyd Dawkins
    verified the discovery by a thorough examination of the forest-bed.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
    Near Minehead the forest consists of oak, ash, alder, and hazel,
    which grew on a blue clay. An ancient growth of oak, ash, and yew is
    found everywhere underneath the peat or alluvium in the Somersetshire
    levels. Throughout this wide area the trees were destroyed by the
    growth of peat, or by the deposits of the floods, except at a few
    isolated spots, which stand at a higher level than usual, in the great
    flat extending between the Polden Hills and the Quantocks. One of
    these oases, a little distance to the west of Middlezoy, is termed the
    Oaks, because those trees form a marked contrast to the prevailing
    elms and willows of the district. In the neighbouring ditches, that
    gradually cut into peat, and then into silt, prostrate oaks are very
    abundant<a id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Subsidence of the land at a remote geological period was the cause of
    the impassable state of these levels in the time of king Alfred, and
    the modern system of drainage which was carried out at a later date
    has been the cause of the improved condition which we see now, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
    which has made the Vale of Taunton Dean proverbial as the Garden of
    England.
  </p>

  <p>
    2. In Alfred’s time the eye was greeted by a variety of trees which
    are not observable now. The elm predominates all over the plain. I
    asked the occupier of Athelney Farm about the trees on his land, and
    he said there was hardly anything but elm. Of other kinds he had
    only two ash-trees and one beech; ‘but (he added) we find bog-oak
    in the moors, and it makes good gate-posts.’ The elms have driven
    out both oak and ash, and whatever other sorts they touched in their
    ‘wrastling’ progress. These sombre grenadiers dress up their lines so
    close as to leave little room for other trees. They suck the fruitful
    soil more than any other tree, and they repay their costly nurture
    with timber of inferior value. Introduced by the Romans to serve as
    stakes and props in the culture of the vine, they have overrun the
    land like the imported rabbits in some of our colonies. In Alfred’s
    day these hungry aliens had not yet usurped the field, and there
    was still room for the display of the rich variety of nature—oak,
    ash, beech, fir, maple, yew, sycamore, hornbeam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> holly, poplar,
    aspen, alder, hazel, wych-elm, apple, cherry, juniper, elder, willow,
    mountain ash, spindle-tree, buckthorn, hawthorn, wild plum, wild pear,
    service-tree, &amp;c. But now, the fair places of the field are encumbered
    by the tall cousins of the nettle, and the most diversified of English
    counties is muffled with a monotonous shroud of outlandish and weedy
    growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the animal world, likewise, the lapse of a thousand years has
    brought change. In the pastures the most frequent animal is the cow,
    and only on rare occasions, as we view the moors from some elevated
    ‘tump,’ have we the chance to see a little company of antlered deer
    careering over the open plain, clearing the rhines with an airy bound.
    In Alfred’s time too, cow-keeping was a stock industry, and we read of
    the king as entertained <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">incognito</i> by one of his own cowherds
    (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">apud quendam suum vaccarium</i>).
  </p>

  <p>
    But the proportion of wild to domesticated animals was far greater
    then than it is now. The whole stretch of country from Pedrida to the
    end of Exmoor, fifty miles long and twenty miles wide, was then almost
    a continuous forest, abounding with game of all kinds, but
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span> especially
    with red deer, which still continues, though in diminished numbers.
    This noble creature is thus described by Bewick:—
  </p>

  <p>
    ‘<span class="smcap">The Stag or Red Deer.</span> This is the most beautiful animal of
    the deer kind. The elegance of his form, the lightness of his motions,
    the flexibility of his limbs, his bold, branching horns, which are
    annually renewed, his grandeur, strength, and swiftness, give him a
    decided pre-eminence over every other inhabitant of the
    forest<a id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.’
  </p>

  <p>
    The red deer still lives and breeds along the southern coast of the
    Severn Sea, and this is I believe the only part of Great Britain in
    which this right royal animal still ranges at large in all the freedom
    of nature. I am informed by my friend Mr. Townshend that in Ireland
    they are kept as an ornament in some gentlemen’s parks, but that in a
    free state of nature they survive only in the mountains of Killarney.

    Here it will be useful to read Leland’s notes of travel across the
    lowlands of Somerset, especially as they touch some places with which
    we are concerned. (I quote from the Proceedings of the Somersetshire
    Archæological and Natural History Society, No. xxxiii, ‘Leland in
    Somersetshire, 1540–1542.’)

  <p>
    Here we may observe that Leland appears to know of no river Parret; to
    him it was ‘Ivel.’ It would be curious to learn when and how a minor
    tributary gave its name of Parret to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
    lower waters of the Ivel.
    It may be surmised that Pedrida was never the name of a river, but of
    a belt of country, and that it may have meant ‘the passage or ford
    of the Peder,’ Leland’s ‘praty broke.’ The name seems to contain the
    Welsh <i xml:lang="cy" lang="cy">rhyd</i>, a ford. At first it may have denoted the ford of the
    Peder, and then by natural extension it may have come to designate the
    whole fenland of the lower Ivel.
  </p>

  <p>
    3. Racial differences were still seen and felt. The West Welsh had
    been conquered, and were now living in peaceful subjection, and
    forming an outlying part of the kingdom of Wessex; but still they were
    imperfectly assimilated.
  </p>

  <p>
    The old internecine quarrel between the races had in this western land
    been hushed and calmed; and on no other border were the British living
    and mingling with their conquerors on such amicable terms. There was
    a very great difference between the disposition of the West Welsh
    towards the Saxon and that of the ‘North Welsh’ on the opposite coast
    of the Severn Sea.
  </p>

  <p>
    These pacific relations were not of recent date; they appear as a
    deliberate policy in the reign of Ina before the end of the seventh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
    century, and even earlier indications of this tendency may be gleaned
    which carry us back two hundred years behind the reign of Alfred.
  </p>

  <p>
    When in 665, Wina<a id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>,
    bishop of Winchester, consecrated Ceadda (St.
    Chad), he had with him two British bishops as his assistants. These
    two bishops must have belonged to the West Welsh. Further, there is
    reason to believe that Ceadwalla, though descended from Cerdic, and
    king of Wessex, was half a Briton. Again: the legendary tales about
    Ina’s legislation which are embodied in the so-called Laws of Edward
    the Confessor, however unhistorical, have possibly a traditional value
    as characterizing the attitude of Wessex towards her British subjects
    in the seventh and eighth centuries. In this apocryphal text it is
    said that by Ina’s enactment ‘the British were declared politically
    equal with the English, and that as he himself had set the example of
    a Welsh marriage, so he would that connubium between the two races
    should <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>be legally recognized.’ These are distorted reminiscences of
    the historical fact that Ina maintained a conciliatory policy towards
    the conquered British, and in this course he was well supported
    or perhaps guided by Aldhelm, abbot of Malmesbury, who in 704 was
    requested by a synod to write a letter to Gerontius (Geraint), king of
    Damnonia, and exhort him and his people to conformity with Catholic
    usage in the time of keeping the Easter festival. The letter was
    sent, and it is still extant. It is addressed, in respectful and
    courteous language—‘To the most glorious prince, swaying the sceptre
    of the Western realm, whom I, the searcher of the heart is my witness,
    do embrace with brotherly charity—to king Geraint and to all God’s
    priests dwelling in Damnonia, Aldhelm, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>’
  </p>

  <p>
    And when, shortly afterwards, Hædde, bishop of Winchester, died, and
    the moment had arrived for the long-contemplated division of the vast
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>diocese of Wessex, Aldhelm became bishop ‘to the west of the wood,’
    over a province which (as Ethelwerd tells us) was commonly called
    Selwoodshire. Aldhelm died in 709 upon one of his episcopal journeys,
    at the village of Doulting on the western brow of Mendip, between
    Wells and Frome. His memory has been locally revived in the present
    century by the discovery of a small Saxon church in Bradford-on-Avon,
    which has been identified by competent judges with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ecclesiola</i>
    which William of Malmesbury says that Aldhelm built in that place.
    To him was probably due the preservation of the British monastery at
    Glastonbury and its endowment by king Ina.
  </p>

  <p>
    That spot was dear to the British patriot as the mysterious sojourn of
    their hero, who in due time was to return and revive the ancient glory
    of the British name. The extant books in which this legend is recorded
    are later than the time of Alfred, but the romance itself is of the
    sixth century. Our oldest English form of it is of about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
    1200.

    All this history was known to Alfred and went to swell the stream
    of his meditations, which tended to assure him that he had a fresh
    and promising field before him, and to mature in him the purpose of
    exerting himself to win the hearty attachment of this well-affected
    but still half alien population.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    Between Twelfth Day and Easter Day of the year 878 there were barely
    eleven weeks, for Easter fell early that year, namely on March 23. Of
    Alfred’s doings in that interval we have no information, except in
    so far as it seems to be indicated that the affair of Cynwit was not
    conducted without his intervention. And we may add the traditional
    story of the cakes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> a story which probably dates from Alfred’s day,
    as we have reasonably good evidence that it was current in the tenth
    century. Nor may we omit his espial of the Danish camp in minstrel
    guise, a legend which, though not found in early authorities, yet
    does claim some credit from the book in which it is narrated, namely
    the <cite>Book of Hyde</cite>—a book in which we might expect to find some early
    traditions of New Minster, one of king Alfred’s foundations.
  </p>

  <p>
    But while we desire to make the most of these items, it must be
    admitted that they constitute an inadequate furniture for eleven
    weeks of Alfred’s time in the most intense crisis of his life. At any
    other point in Alfred’s career, the silence of so many weeks might
    not provoke remark, but at this moment it makes a sensible void. If,
    however, we rightly apprehend the situation of the fugitive king,
    his hopes and his fears, his aims and his resources, we may (in the
    light of the great result) indulge a sober imagination without fear of
    considerable error.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the pieces of genuine tradition which seem to greet the explorer
    in Asser’s <cite>Life</cite>, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> is perhaps none on which we may more
    confidently lean than a certain fragment in the paragraph beginning
    ‘Interea tamen rex<a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.’
  </p>

  <p>
    The drift of this context is that with all his wars and frequent
    interruptions, Alfred ruled his kingdom, and ‘practised every
    branch of the craft of venery; directed his goldsmiths and all his
    artificers; did moreover instruct the falconers and hawk-catchers and
    dog-trainers; and by his own novel engineering constructed buildings
    beyond all former wont, statelier and more costly; had Saxon books
    read to him, and commanded others to learn Saxon poems by heart, &amp;c.’
  </p>

  <p>
    In this passage I seem to recognize a true historic note; and I think
    that in this picture of the range of his powers, and the roll of his
    accomplishments, his vast activity and versatility, we have some
    genuine reminiscences of the personality of Alfred. In the emphasis
    here laid on hunting, we may recognize the king who, some years
    later, sent a present of wolfhounds to the archbishop of Rheims, and
    such <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>dogs, too, that their quality and breed was accentuated by the
    receiver in his grateful acknowledgement<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. And when to this we add
    that he could make and sing a song, could tell a good tale, could
    make choice of men and win their confidence, we need little aid from
    imagination to perceive how this mysterious visitor might captivate
    the British hearts of all Somerset like one man, and perhaps set them
    wondering whether it could be their own ideal king Arthur come back to
    them again.
  </p>

  <p>
    During nearly three months of that eventful year his aim was to
    cultivate closer relations with the people of that outlying territory,
    desiring that they might become attached to him with sentiments of
    loyalty and friendship. To devote himself to this undertaking was at
    once his duty, his interest, and his delight. For such an achievement
    as this he had advantages both natural and acquired. Apart from war,
    there is nothing like hunting for making comrades, if a man have a
    genial soul and be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>himself a mighty hunter. Alfred <em>was</em> a mighty
    hunter and a genial soul, and close at hand there was one of the
    finest hunting-grounds in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Immediately from the Pedridan swamp the ground began to rise to north
    and north-west towards a run of hilly and woodland country forty miles
    long, and from ten to twenty miles broad; a country which remains
    singular to this day for its natural breed of red deer and its chase
    of the great game. This royal sport survives on Exmoor and in the
    Quantocks, and there are Minehead people who can tell you that they
    have seen the stag-hunt scamper through their main street in full cry.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the entrance of this country, at a point which is conveniently
    situated for uniting activity inland with a constant observation of
    the line of Pedrida, is a village which is now called North Newton,
    with which Petherton Park had been so long and closely linked that it
    went by the popular name of Newton Park. I am led by a number of small
    indications to infer that this is the place where Alfred had his chief
    residence during those early months of the year 878.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

  <p>
    When Easter came, his action began to be overt; he dropped personal
    disguise, and stood forth as <span class="smcap">Ælfred cyning</span>. ‘When Easter
    came, king Alfred, with a small force, constructed a fort at Athelney,
    and out of that fort was warring against the invading host, he and
    the men of Somerset, that portion of them which was nighest<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.’
    This is the action of a commander who has made sure of his following,
    and is now beginning his operations against the enemy. He fortifies
    himself on the east side of the bridge, where a conical hill offers an
    opportune position; and from that basis he opens a guerilla warfare
    with the invaders. He does not show his hand: he rather wants to be
    thought weak. This naturally draws away from head quarters more and
    more of the hostile force, who think that they shall presently deal a
    last blow to the Saxon resistance. And so with a petty and apparently
    futile display of military force, he continues to amuse and distract
    the enemy for the next six weeks.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

  <p>
    The impression made on the mind of the people by these events is
    traceable in two names: Athelney, which now represents Æthelinga Eig,
    the island of princes; and Borough Bridge, which means the bridge
    at the fortification. The fort which Alfred made in 878 is well
    preserved, the entrenchments occupying the summit of a conical hill
    near the east end of the bridge which spans the Parret, after its
    junction with the Tone.
  </p>

  <p>
    How the king had employed the unrecorded months is manifest in
    the result. His muster-roll at Brixton Deveril, in the words of a
    contemporary, is brief yet eloquent: ‘Then in the seventh week after
    Easter he rode to Ecgbrihtes Stân, on the eastern side of Selwood, and
    to meet him at that place came the men of Somerset, all of them, and
    the Wiltshire men, and of Hampshire the part that was on the hither
    side of the sea; and of him fain they were.’ This passage of the
    <cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite> seems to render a satisfactory account of the manner
    in which the king had employed his time from Epiphany to Easter in the
    year 878.
  </p>

  <p>
    Absorbed in this supreme effort, where his all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> was at stake, he may
    well have found no time for recovering his buried Jewel, and he may
    never have revisited the spot until his marks were all obliterated.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the land beyond Pedrida, which had hitherto counted to the crown
    of Wessex only as a recent territorial acquisition, now started up
    around the fugitive king an army of devoted warriors, who resolutely
    threw their weight into the scale, and rescued the dynasty of their
    conquerors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such was the nature of the force which Alfred now with a swelling
    heart perceived to be entirely at his disposal, and he buckled to the
    task of employing them to the best advantage. From the entrenched hill
    by Borough Bridge he prosecuted the war against the Danes, whose basis
    was at Chippenham, and this he continued for six weeks. This he could
    do with a small force, as he had great advantages of position. Between
    him and the foe lay the fenny channel of the Brue, which he and his
    people were expert in crossing. So it was comparatively easy for him
    to harass them and retire to his fort.
  </p>

  <p>
    This kind of warfare, continued for six weeks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> must have had the
    designed effect of drawing off from the strength of the foe in
    Wiltshire, and causing them to concentrate their attention upon this
    feigned line of attack. For all this was only to amuse and distract
    the enemy, and so to facilitate the execution of a very different
    project, which the king was preparing. What was passing in Alfred’s
    mind may (in all essentials) be read in Lord Roberts’s narrative of
    his preparations for attacking the Afghans, when they were entrenched
    on the Peiwar Kotal in December, 1878<a id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. By making display of
    reconnoitring parties and other preparations as for a front attack,
    carrying this on to the extent of raising batteries and mounting guns,
    till he had caused the enemy to make counter dispositions accordingly,
    he with the utmost secrecy by a circuitous night march made a flank
    attack, taking them unprepared, and promptly dislodged them from an
    apparently impregnable position. So Alfred, while waging the six
    weeks’ war, had his trusty messengers abroad all through Wiltshire and
    Hampshire, preparing for the tryst at Ecgbrihtes Stân.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

  <p>
    Well may we exclaim with Sir Walter Besant—‘What follows is like a
    dream!’ Yea, verily, like a dream in its sudden transformation of
    the whole face and prospect of things, and equally unaccountable
    too; for no attempt to explain it by natural causes will ever match
    the stupendous result. It is not in order to dispel an illusion that
    we seek to trace the plan and the process—the illusion cannot be
    dispelled. No, rather it is in order to penetrate further into the
    action of a life that has kindled our admiration. Of that life we have
    a mirror in the enthusiasm with which his presence had fired the Welsh
    of Somerset beyond Pedrida. It is surely no mere accident that in the
    memorandum of that resolute force which mustered for his restoration,
    the first item should be—<span class="smcap">Sumorsæte alle</span>.

    Among promising fields of exercise in exploring the bed
    of the sea, there is the coast from Swanage Bay round to St. Aldhelm’s
    Head, which might yield some durable relics from the loot of ancient
    monasteries. And if Alfred really did purchase the evacuation of
    Wareham in 877, ‘pecuniam dando,’ as Ethelwerd has it, the very coins
    may still be there, and in a good state of preservation.

      <span class="medium">NEWTON PARK AND FAIRFIELD HOUSE</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">From</span> the date of its discovery in 1693 down to the present time, the
    name of ‘Newton Park’ has been associated with the Alfred Jewel as
    designating the property on which it was found. In our day, however,
    this name is no longer recognized in the neighbourhood, and indeed it
    is apt to be misleading. For this title is now current in Somerset in
    another sense, namely, as denoting the seat of Earl Temple at Newton
    St. Loe, near Bath. Still the honorific appellation of ‘Newton Park,’
    for the estate on which the Jewel was discovered, will be found to
    rest upon historic antecedents, which are full of interest, and not
    devoid of suggestiveness for the purpose of our present investigation.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

  <p>
    The extant mention of this Newton carries us back a good space behind
    the Norman Conquest. The Will of Ælfric, archbishop of Canterbury, who
    died in 1006, affords evidence that he was a landowner in Newton. It
    is not generally possible to identify a place by a name which became
    so common, but the coupling of it in Abp. Ælfric’s Will with the name
    of Fiddington, removes all uncertainty. The passage in the Will (which
    is cast in the third person) runs thus: ‘And the land in the West
    Country at Fiddington and at Newton he bequeathed to his sisters and
    their children<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.’
  </p>

  <p>
    In the forest laws, which grew up after the Conquest, we find that the
    custody of the royal forest of North Petherton was a serjeanty, which
    was attached to the Manor of Newton and caused it to be distinguished
    by the name of Newton Forester. When this Manor was granted by King
    John to William de Wrotham, it was declared that he held it by the
    service of being <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>the king’s forester in the counties of Somerset,
    Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall. As he does not appear to have exercised
    his office beyond the county of Somerset, this territorial definition
    suggests that some vague prerogative had attached to Newton Manor at
    an earlier time.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the third generation from the above grant this Manor passed with
    an heiress into the hands of William de Placetis. A generation later
    it was divided between three co-heiresses, Sabina, Evelina, and
    Emma. Then arose a question about the office of Forester, and it
    was found that it appertained to a particular messuage and meadow,
    and that these were included within the portion of Sabina, so she
    was declared Forester in fee of the forests of Exmoor, Neroche,
    Selwood, and Mendip, likewise custodian of the warren of Somerton;
    and these offices she discharged by deputy. In her time (26 Edw. I)
    occurred the Perambulation of the forests of the county, in pursuance
    of the Charter of the Forests which had been granted by Henry III.
    The forests were to be reduced to their ancient and lawful bounds,
    according to their limits at the accession of Henry I. The annual
    value of the lands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> then disafforested was more than a hundred times
    as great as that of the legal forest of North Petherton.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the time of Edward III the Manor of Newton with its rights
    and appurtenances belonged to Roger, earl of Mortimer, in whose
    descendants and in the dukes of York it continued to the time of
    Edward IV, when it came to the Crown, and then the Manor was quoted
    as Newton Regis. During this period the powers of Forester were
    delegated, and some interesting names occur in the list of deputies:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      14 Ric. II. Richard Brettle and Gefferey Chaucer, esqrs., by the
      appointment of the earl of March.
    </p>

    <p>21 Ric. II. Gefferey Chaucer, by Alienor, countess of March.</p>

    <p>4 Hen. V. Thomas Chaucer, by Edward, earl of March.</p>

    <p>8 Hen. VI. William Wrothe and Thomas Attemore.</p>

    <p>12 Hen. VI. William Wrothe.</p>

    <p>
      29 Hen. VI. Sir William Bonville and Richard Luttrell, by the duke of
      York.
    </p>

    <p>14 Edw. IV. Sir Giles D’Aubeny, for life.</p>

    <p>23 Hen. VII. Robert Wrothe, for thirty years.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Soon after the expiration of which term Sir Thomas Wrothe, son and
    heir of the last-named Robert, purchased of Edward VI the fee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> of
    Petherton Park and the Manor of Newton Regis. The office of Forester
    had now fallen into decay and the ancient glory had departed, and
    the transfer of this property appears to have been governed by
    the ordinary considerations. In the time of Queen Elizabeth the
    descendants of Sir Thomas pulled down the park house, and carried the
    materials to a lodge called the Broad Lodge, which (said Collinson in
    1791) ‘the late Sir Thomas Wrothe improved to a handsome dwelling.
    The whole park<a id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> is now converted into farms.’ The improvements of
    Sir Thomas Wrothe, here mentioned, have a probable connexion with our
    subject.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such is the remarkable history of the Manor which has been at
    different times known as Newton Forester, Newton Placey, Newton Regis,
    and Newton Wrothe; and this history ministers occasion for a surmise
    that the distinction which attended this Manor may have had its roots
    considerably further back, inasmuch as the extant records do not offer
    an adequate account of that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>peculiar prerogative which made it so
    famous and so dignified.
  </p>

  <p>
    I venture to suggest that the beginnings of this place, which has
    been so eminent, and which is now known by the comparatively obscure
    name of North Newton, may have been connected with the retreat of
    the king to Athelney, that this may have been a spot of his own
    selection. It is reached from Athelney by simply following the rise of
    the ground, it is well placed for keeping an eye on the Parret, the
    side from which a surprize was most to be apprehended, and it was the
    approach to the fine hunting-fields of Quantock and Exmoor. What more
    natural than that he should take a liking to the place and judge it
    convenient for a hunting-lodge? And I venture to throw out a surmise
    for consideration. May it not be that the prefix ‘New’ was set by the
    king himself, who gave the name of New Minster to his foundation at
    Winchester<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>?
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

  <p>
    The name of Newton properly belonged only to the Manor, but as the
    lordship of this Manor was long coupled with the custody of Petherton
    Park, and as the two were habitually associated in men’s minds, the
    latter came to be spoken of as ‘Newton Park,’ and this title is simply
    a colloquial variation and equivalent for Petherton Park. The correct
    name of Petherton Park is constantly used by Leland in the extract
    from his <cite>Itinerary</cite> which is given in the previous chapter. So that
    when the Alfred Jewel is said to have been found in Newton Park, this
    is only a popular way of saying that it was found in Petherton Park.
    The discovery occurred in the time of Sir Thomas Wrothe, who was also
    the enlarger of the mansion, and it is a probable inference that it
    was found in the excavations which were required for this work<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    The scene now shifts from Newton to the neighbouring parish of
    Stogursey or, as modern research has taught us to write it, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>Stoke
    Courcy. In this parish is Fairfield House, a handsome Elizabethan
    mansion in which the Alfred Jewel was preserved for a quarter of a
    century, from the time of its discovery in 1693, until it was given to
    the University of Oxford in 1718<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    About the time of Henry II the lands of ‘Ferfelle’ were severed from
    those of Honibere, and erected into a separate estate.
  </p>

  <p>
    By-and-by the name slid into a new form, conveying a new idea. The
    new name into which it merged is one that has been freely propagated
    both at home and in the colonies, with pleasing associations of soft
    and gently undulating landscape suggestive of homely scenery and a
    sheltered situation. Very different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> is the connotation of the name
    in its documentary form. In ‘Ferfelle’ we can see only some outlying
    ‘remoter fell,’ such as would be little visited save for uses of
    summer pasture. In Collinson’s picture of the mansion, which is here
    reproduced, while the foreground seems to justify the modern name,
    the hills and hanging woods at the back of the house seem to bear out
    the more primitive signification of an outlying mountain fell. And
    probably this was also the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> idea which originally gave name to the
    well-known mountain in Westmoreland over Grasmere.

    <div class="caption">FAIRFIELD HOUSE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    After a succession of owners of various names this new estate came
    (14 Edw. I) into the possession of William de Vernai, who had married
    the sole daughter and heiress of the previous proprietor. For nearly
    three hundred years there was always a Vernai at Fairfield. In 12 Edw.
    IV the Vernai of that day (the fourth of the name of William) had a
    licence to build a wall and seven round towers about his mansion-house
    at Fairfield, and to enclose two hundred acres of ground for a park.
    ‘The tomb in the Vernais isle in the fine old Priory church of Stoke
    Courcy, with an image of an armed man lying thereon, belongs to this
    William Vernai’ (Collinson).
  </p>

  <p>
    Fairfield had come into the family of Vernai by an heiress, and at
    length it passed in the same manner to the family of Palmer. Hugh de
    Vernai left one only daughter, and she was called Elizabeth, after
    the great queen, who was her godmother. On the death of her father
    her wardship was granted to Sir Thomas Palmer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> of Parham, in the
    county of Sussex, Knt.; to whose only son, William, she was afterwards
    married. Soon after this marriage, Sir Thomas Palmer pulled down the
    old house, and began the present mansion, which was completed by his
    grandson (also Sir Thomas Palmer, Knt.), who inherited Fairfield in
    1587. This proprietor was not a keeper at home. In 1595 he was with
    Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins in the expedition to Porto
    Rico, and afterwards commanded a ship at the taking of Cadiz, where he
    was knighted. He was one of the most considerable persons in the Court
    of Queen Elizabeth; but on the accession of King James he resolved to
    spend the remainder of his days beyond the seas, and accordingly, in
    the year 1605, he went with the earl of Nottingham into Spain, where,
    as he was providing a settlement for his family at Valladolid, he died
    of the small-pox, and was there buried.
  </p>

  <p>
    William Palmer, his son and heir, was a man of learning, and chose
    to live in London, and he was, in the time of Charles I, fined a
    thousand pounds by the Star Chamber for disobedience to the king’s
    proclamation, which required all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> persons of estate to reside and keep
    hospitality at their country houses.
  </p>

  <p>
    His brother Peregrine, who succeeded him, went as a volunteer to the
    Palatinate wars, and was afterwards an officer in the Swedish army.
    As soon as the royal standard was set up he repaired to Nottingham,
    and faithfully served King Charles in the commissions of major,
    lieutenant-colonel, and colonel of horse, being present at the battles
    of Edgehill, Marston Moor, Cropredy Bridge, and Naseby. He died in
    1684, having married Anne, the daughter of Nathaniel Stevens, in
    the county of Gloucester, Esq., and he was succeeded in the estate
    by his eldest surviving son, Nathaniel, who is reported in the
    <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite> as the possessor of the Alfred Jewel in
    the year 1698<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. He served in several parliaments for the boroughs
    of Minehead and Bridgwater, and for the county of Somerset. The first
    recorded possessor of the Alfred Jewel died in 1717. He was succeeded
    by his son Thomas, who resided at Fairfield, where he lived a studious
    life, investigating the antiquities of his country. His <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>manuscript is
    preserved at Fairfield, and it was a valuable source of information to
    Collinson, the historian of Somerset. It is from this source we learn
    that the Jewel was ‘dug up,’ an expression which seems to justify the
    inference that it was not accidentally lost, but purposely buried<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
    It was he who, in 1718, gave the Alfred Jewel to the University of Oxford.
  </p>

  <p>
    He married a daughter of Sir Thomas Wrothe of Petherton Park, who
    died in 1721, leaving two daughters co-heiresses. The elder of these
    was married to Sir Hugh Acland, of Columb-John in the county of
    Devon, Bart., and the younger to Mr. Thomas Palmer, who died without
    issue. He was succeeded by his brother Peregrine, who represented the
    University of Oxford in several parliaments, and died in 1762, the
    last survivor of his name and family. He left his estate to Arthur
    Acland, Esq., his next of kin, from whom it has descended to Sir
    Alexander Acland Hood, Baronet, the present owner of the Fairfield
    estate.

    To be quite exact, its lodging for the first five years
    is matter of inference from the fact that in 1698 it is described as
    being at Fairfield, without any indication of a change of ownership.
    One transfer however there must have been. The place of discovery made
    it the property of Sir Thomas Wrothe; and as Nathaniel Palmer was his
    mother’s brother, it is easy to understand the gift of the nephew to
    his uncle, who may have been a man of antiquarian tastes. We can also
    understand the desire of Nathaniel Palmer that this precious relic
    should go to Oxford, as he, with many others of his family, had been
    educated at the University, of which Alfred was the reputed founder.

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">The</span> earliest recorded doubt as to the identity of the <span class="smcap">Ælfred</span>
    of the Jewel with Alfred of Wessex was grounded upon the high artistic
    quality of the work<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. It may therefore be illustrative if we advert
    to some other specimens of English jewellery belonging to those early
    times. One such has already been quoted above (p. 68), namely, the
    ‘enamelled ouche’ of Mr. Roach Smith, which is now in the British
    Museum. This is a piece of great beauty and high technical skill; and
    it has every appearance of belonging to these times, but there is
    nothing to fix its date more definitely. Happily, there are specimens
    of English jewellery of the ninth century which exclude this doubt. We
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>have no less than three inscribed gold rings which certainly belonged
    to eminent contemporaries of Alfred, and two of them to members of his
    family circle; insomuch that we may say, with some confidence, that
    these two must have been familiar objects to his eye.
  </p>

  <p><span class="smcap">The Ring of Alhstan, who was Bishop of Sherborne from 824 to 867.</span></p>

  <p>
    In chronological order the first of these three rings is one that
    bears the name of <span class="smcap">Alhstan</span>. It was found in the year 1753 at
    Llysfaen, in the county of Carnarvon. It was figured and described
    in the <cite>Archæologia</cite>, iv. 47, by Mr. Pegge, whose letter is dated
    July 6, 1771. He identified the name with Ealhstan or Ealchstan, the
    warlike bishop of Sherborne. It may seem strange that the bishop of
    Sherborne’s ring should be found in Carnarvonshire; but the <cite>Saxon
    Chronicle</cite> suggests a simple and natural explanation. In the year
    853 Æthelwulf, king of Wessex, was petitioned by the king and Witan
    of Mercia to aid them in the subjugation of the Welsh, who were in
    rebellion. Consequently, Æthelwulf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> marched with an army into Wales,
    and restored the imperial authority of Mercia.
  </p>

  <p>
    This operation (which was part of the defence of the country against
    the Danes, whom the Welsh of Cambria were prone to support) would
    naturally have been conducted with the advice and under the management
    of Alhstan<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. The name Llysfaen (‘Stone Court’) fitly describes
    the rocky enclosure in which the ring was found, and in which we may
    suppose that the final negotiations were conducted. Preoccupation
    of mind in momentous business makes it easy to imagine how the old
    war-chief of Æthelwulf might have lost his ring. Among the selfsame
    rocks of Llysfaen, and near the spot where the Alhstan ring was
    discovered, another ring was shortly afterwards found, containing a
    greater weight of gold, but of comparatively rude workmanship, and not
    inscribed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Alhstan ring now belongs to the Waterton Collection, which is
    preserved in the South <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>Kensington Museum. It is of that type (not
    uncommon in Roman rings) which suggests derival from a string of
    beads. The lettering occupies four circular compartments, which
    alternating with four lozenge-shaped compartments, constitute the
    hoop of the ring. Pegge saw the dragon of Wessex in the grotesque
    animals which occupy the lozenge-shaped compartments. The characters
    are beautiful Roman capitals of Anglo-Saxon type, except the N, which
    is represented by the Rune <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-r" src="images/rune185.jpg" alt="ᚾ" width="32" height="35" />.</span>
    Besides the <cite>Archæologia</cite>, the
    ring is figured in <cite>Art Treasures of the United Kingdom</cite>, a monumental
    book which was published in connexion with the Manchester Exhibition
    of 1857.

    The second of the three rings is inscribed in the above form with the
    name of Alfred’s father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> king Ethelwulf, for whom it was evidently

    In 1781, March 22, Lord Radnor brought this find before the Society
    of Antiquaries. It had been found in the summer of 1780 in a field in
    the parish of Laverstoke, near Salisbury. According to the finder’s
    story, it was brought to the surface by the pressure of a cart-wheel,
    and it lay exposed on the edge of the rut. Mr. Howell, a silversmith
    in Salisbury, gave the man thirty-four shillings for the value of the
    gold, and Lord Radnor bought it of Mr. Howell. It still shows the
    effect of hard pressure, being almost flattened. It was figured in the
    <cite>Archæologia</cite>, vii. 421, and repeatedly since. It is preserved in the
    British Museum.

    In the two rings already described, the names of Alhstan and Æthelwulf
    belong to the fabric of the rings, as the name of Ælfred belongs to
    the fabric of the Jewel. But it is different in the ring of queen
    Æthelswith.

  <p>
    This ring swells out into a dilated bezil, on the cop of which is
    an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agnus Dei</i>, beautifully engraved in relief, with a background
    of niello. The interior of this bezil (which would be in contact
    with the wearer’s finger) was a fair gold surface when the ring was
    finished and put out of hand by the goldsmith. Subsequently, the
    name of Æthelswith has been incised upon that surface with the fine
    point of a graving tool, somewhat in this form:
	  <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-cross" src="images/cross.jpg" alt="✠" width="48" height="45" /></span>
    <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-c" src="images/i_187c.jpg" alt="EAƉELSVIƉ REGNA" width="598" height="56" /></span>
    where the

    is a monogram for IN, so that the inscription reads

    <span class="smcap">Æthelswith Regina</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The incision is so slight and so fresh that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> is manifest the ring
    had no considerable wear after it was done<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.

    Æthelswith was the daughter of Æthelwulf and sister of Alfred, and
    consort of Burgred, king of Mercia, who was driven out by the Danes
    in 874, and retired to Rome, where he died. Æthelswith died in 888 at
    Pavia, apparently on pilgrimage. The annal recording it runs thus:
    ‘888. This year the alms of the West Saxons and of king Alfred were
    conducted to Rome by “Beocca ealdorman.” And queen Æthelswith, who was
    king Alfred’s sister, died, and was buried at Pavia<a id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.’

  <p>
    This fine nielloed ring was found near Aberford in Yorkshire, in or
    about the year 1870. It was first observed by a ploughman at the point
    of his ploughshare. He brought it to his master, who, thinking it
    brass, attached it to his dog’s collar, where it hung until some one
    assured him it was gold, whereupon he carried it to a silversmith at
    York, and exchanged it for spoons. From this dealer it was purchased
    by Canon Greenwell of Durham, from whom it passed into the possession
    of Sir Wollaston Franks, and ultimately by his bequest came to the
    British Museum.

  <p>
    When we consider how very small is the whole number of extant gold
    rings (whether inscribed or not) that date from the Saxon period, it
    must strike us as a very remarkable circumstance that we are able
    to produce three such examples, all within the period of Alfred’s
    life, and two of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> them belonging to such near relations that we may
    naturally suppose they were familiar objects to his eye.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    And there is a fourth ring, of which we cannot assert that it belongs
    to this very select group, but which certainly must be assigned to the
    same general period, and claims association with the three. It is a
    simple hoop of gold, a good quarter of an inch wide, having its outer
    surface covered with the following engraved inscription nielloed<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>:

  <p>
    Hickes described this ring in his <cite>Thesaurus</cite> (Preface, pp. viij and
    xiij) with a good figure: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
    but in the interpretation he read the last
    word as <span class="smcap">agroft</span>, taking an idle mark like an inverted T as
    part of the word; whereas it is there only to fill out the space. In
    the lettering there are five Runes: namely, the Æ in <span class="smcap">Æðred</span>,
    the N in <span class="smcap">Eanred</span>, and the A, G, and F in <span class="smcap">agrof</span>. This
    is the ring which was alluded to above (p. 17), in connexion with the
    archaic pronoun <span class="smcap">mec</span>, which occurs twice on it.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1705, when this ring was described by Hickes, it was in the
    possession of Dr. Hans Sloane: it is now in the British Museum.
  </p>

  <p>
    The forms ‘Æthred’ and ‘Æthered’ are colloquial abbreviations of
    ‘Æthelred,’ which was the name of that one among the brothers of
    Alfred, with whom his relations were closest. But the frequency of the
    name forbids us to assert that this ring was made for king Æthelred.
    The names ‘Æthelwulf’ and ‘Æthelswith’ are in themselves exceptional,
    and when combined with the royal title are absolutely identifying:
    the name ‘Alhstan,’ combined with the peculiar aspect of the ring and
    the circumstances of its discovery, not much less so; but the name
    ‘<span class="smcap">Æthred</span>,’ though forcibly aided by the noble aspect of the
    ring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
    only enables us to assert a degree of probability which every
    one must determine for himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything in the appearance of these rings declares them to be the
    work of Saxon artists, and on the <span class="smcap">Æðred</span> ring the artist bears
    a good Saxon name. Such specimens must finally dissipate any lingering
    relics of the old prejudice, that the work of the Alfred Jewel is too
    good to have been produced in the England of the ninth century. We
    may rest assured that the excellence of the workmanship carries with
    it no presumption against its being English work of the time of king
    <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>.

      <span class="medium">SOME CLOSING REFLECTIONS</span>
    </h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">Among</span> the various criticisms which have been elicited by the Alfred
    Jewel during the two hundred and seven years which have elapsed since
    its discovery in the year 1693, the opinion that the name it bears
    is that of the king has not met with more than one definite and
    formulated objection. This objection, if it had prevailed, would have
    excluded the production of such a work in king Alfred’s time, as a
    thing impossible. But the question thus raised has evoked evidence of
    so overpowering a nature as not only to neutralize the objection, but
    also to increase the balance of probability in favour of the opinion
    that the person named on the Jewel is Alfred of Wessex.
  </p>

  <p>
    The name, combined with the costliness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> the strongly marked
    individuality of the work, draws the mind naturally to think of the
    most remarkable person who bore that name; but, in addition, we have
    to consider that it was found in the neighbourhood of the very spot
    which is most closely associated with the career of the selfsame
    person. In these obvious prima facie elements of the case, there is an
    accumulation of probability, which fully justified Hickes in saying
    that from his first sight of the Jewel he had never doubted its having
    been a personal possession of king Alfred’s<a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To this central and primary body of evidence other instances of
    probability have been added in the course of the present Essay. The
    investigation of the Epigraph led us to the conclusion that the
    diction answered well to the time of king Alfred’s life, and also that
    it bore some resemblance to an analogous piece of his admitted writing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our examination of theories concerning the design and use of the Jewel
    resulted in the conclusion that the suggestions hitherto advanced were
    inadmissible, and of no other value than <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>as narrowing the field of
    conjecture. We at least know a number of things that have appeared
    plausible in their time, and are now no more to be thought of; namely,
    an amulet, a pendant to a collar of state, a decorated umbilicus, the
    head of a stilus, a military standard, the handle of a book-pointer,
    the tip of a sceptre.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our review of the abortiveness of early speculations concerning the
    design and use of the Jewel drove us by a process of elimination
    to seek a place for it in the helmet. In favour of this new theory
    historical evidence has been adduced, such as has not been offered
    in support of any other explanation. Unless this theory is approved,
    both the Alfred Jewel and the minor jewel from Minster Lovel remain
    without explanation. There is not so much as a theory in the field. On
    the other hand, if this new theory is judged to be right, or to have
    high probability, then this circumstance makes strongly in favour of
    the identification of the Jewel with king Alfred. For it points to a
    warrior, a helmet-wearer, and to a person of commanding position.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the effects of the present investigation upon myself has been
    to convince me (in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
    face of what I counted a settled opinion) that
    the enamelled Figure is a product of these islands; and that it is not
    necessary for us to look abroad towards Byzantium, or further east,
    for a satisfactory account of it. This unity again is in favour of
    identification with Alfred of Wessex, whose conspicuous interest in
    jewellers’ work is asserted by a well-sustained tradition.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    The symbolism of the Jewel appears to contain an allegorical
    representation of the designer’s position, both inherited and chosen,
    both national and personal. His religious standing is pictured in the
    Figure and its back-plate; and the ancient religion of his nation in
    the boar’s head, once dominant, now under foot, forming a pedestal
    for the Head of the Church. And to this I will add the surmise, that
    perhaps the scales or waves on the small triangular space in the
    reverse signify that his country is an island in the ocean.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am not without apprehension that these explanations may strike some
    readers as too minute and too far-fetched, and that I may be charged
    with bringing out of the Jewel more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
    than is in it. I will therefore
    endeavour to anticipate this charge with a few apologetic words. And
    first of all, I think it well to state that I did not set out with
    any idea of discovering latent meanings in the Jewel. When first I
    discoursed upon it, I contented myself with exhibiting drawings of
    the object, narrating the story of the discovery, explaining the
    inscription, and rehearsing the opinions which had been put forward
    concerning such a remarkable find. This furnished material to fill
    an hour, and to satisfy an audience. Whatever I have added to the
    traditional exegesis has broken in upon me from time to time at wide
    intervals, causing me on such occasions more surprize and pleasure
    than I can hope to impart to my readers.
  </p>

  <p>
    For those who would test the symbolism of the Jewel, there is an
    obvious preliminary question. Is there any reason to think that Alfred
    had an aptitude and a fondness for allegory? This question has been
    to me a valuable guide in observations on the extant writings of the
    king. It would be easy to show, by examples drawn from his writings,
    that he had a marked fondness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
    for imagery and parable, that his
    habit of mind inclined to all figures of analogy and similitude. It
    was not a previous knowledge of these in the writings that led me to
    look for them in the Jewel, but reversely. I am not aware that any one
    had called attention to this characteristic in the writings: I do not
    think I apprehended it from any other source than the Jewel itself. In
    regard to this particular feature, the Jewel has (for me) thrown light
    on the writings, and these again have reflected illustration back upon
    the Jewel. I hope this explanation may make it easier for some to
    think that the imagery of the Jewel is a strong indication that Alfred
    of Wessex was the designer.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was with this aim that, in chapter vii, I quoted the poetical
    Epilogue to Alfred’s <cite>Pastoralis</cite>, and with the same aim I now proceed
    to quote a long-drawn simile in prose, which the king inserted into
    his translation of Boethius’ <cite>De Consolatione Philosophiæ</cite>. It is in
    the fourth book, where the discussion is about Providence and Fate<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

  <p>
    In the abstract and implicit manner natural to the sage of a mature
    and over-blown culture, Boethius had illustrated the relation between
    Providence and Fate by the relation between the centre of the circle
    and its circumference. This analogy is stated in mathematical fashion.
    A series of concentric circles offer points of external contact more
    numerous in some and less numerous in others, according as their
    circumference is nearer or further from the common centre, but the
    centre itself is unaffected by such chances; it remains always the
    same, one and indivisible. The stable centre is Divine Providence;
    by the various contact of the circumferences with external things is
    represented the vicissitude of Fate or Fortune.
  </p>

  <p>
    This refined similitude was translated by king Alfred, out of the
    diamond-cut succinct Latin of Boethius, into the homely speech of his
    own people, by means of a concrete figure that was familiar to every
    son of the soil.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Accordingly some things in this world are subject to Fate, some are
      no whit subject thereto: but Fate, and all the things subject to
      it, are in subjection to Divine Providence. Concerning this I can
      rehearse unto thee a similitude, whereby thou mayest the better
      understand, which men be subject to Fate, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
      and which be not. All this
      moving and revolving creation revolves upon God, who is immovable,
      unchangeable, and one: and he wieldeth all creatures just as he at
      the first had ordained, and still doth ordain.
    </p>

    <p>
      As on a waggon’s axle the wheels revolve and the axle standeth still
      and beareth the whole waggon and governs all the motion; while the
      wheel turns about, and the nave next to the axle moves more steadily
      and more securely than the fellies do: in such a manner that the
      axle is the highest good, which we call God, and the happiest men
      move nighest to God, even as the nave moveth nighest to the axle,
      and the middling sort are just like the spokes; forasmuch as every
      spoke hath one end fast in the nave and the other end in the felly.
      So it is with men of the middling sort; at one time he thinks in his
      mind about this earthly life, at another time about the heavenly;
      like a man looking with one eye to heaven and with the other to
      earth. Just as the spokes have one end sticking in the felly and the
      other in the nave, while the middle of the spoke is equally near to
      both, even so are the middling men in the middle of the spoke, and
      the better men nearer to the nave, and the meaner men nearer to the
      fellies: they are, however, in connexion with the nave, and the nave
      with the axle. So now, the fellies though they are attached to the
      spokes, yet are they altogether rolling upon the earth; so are the
      meanest connected with the middling and the middling with the best
      and the best with God. Though the meanest men all direct their love
      to this world, yet can they not rest thereon, nor be of any account,
      unless they be in some measure associated with God, any more than
      the wheel’s fellies can be in progress, unless they be attached to
      the spokes and the spokes to the axle. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
      fellies are the farthest
      from the axle; therefore they move the most unevenly. The nave moves
      next to the axle; and that is why it has the surest motion. So do
      the happiest men: as they set their love nearer to God, and more
      resolutely contemn these earthly things, so are they more free from
      care, and less they reck how Fate may chance to turn, or what it
      may bring. In like manner the nave is continually so sure, jolt the
      fellies on whatso they may jolt; and this even though the nave is
      somewhat apart from the axle. By this figure thou mayest understand
      that as the waggon is much more durably sound, the less it is parted
      from the axle; so are those men the freest of all from care (whether
      about anxieties of this life or of the next) who are fast in God: but
      in whatever degree they are asunder from God, in the same degree are
      they worried and harassed, both in mind and in body.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This prose simile is unquestioned as an original piece of king
    Alfred’s authorship, and so is also the poetical epilogue to his
    <cite>Pastoralis</cite>, which was quoted above in the seventh chapter. Can
    any one doubt that his mind was exuberantly fertile in allegorical
    thought, and shall it be judged a thing improbable that in his
    imaginative youth, having recently passed through a very grand and
    rude transition of experience, he should have strained the plasticity
    of a favourite craft to body forth the symbolic expression of thoughts
    too deep for common speech?
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

  <p>
    As the course of investigation into the variety and unity of this
    composite Jewel brings it more and more home to the creative mind of
    Alfred, the conviction rises that this work represents no passing
    freak of artistic fancy, nor the fond elaboration of some fascinating
    idea (as in a sonnet); but rather that we have before us the
    thoughtful record of a period of life and a phase of some duration,
    containing serious reflections by one who had reached a higher stage
    of observation, a stage commanding a wider outlook. Of some such
    a crisis as this the Alfred Jewel appears to be the pictorial and
    symbolic monument.
  </p>

  <p>
    And if this impression is sound, it ought to help us to some further
    conclusions. We ought with this help to be able to form some estimate
    of the period in which this Jewel was designed. However we may lament
    the poverty of detailed incident in the life of Alfred, we are not
    ignorant of its main divisions. And we are now in a position to ask—To
    which of these divisions does this carefully elaborated design most
    naturally belong?
  </p>

  <p>
    In seeking materials for the answer to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
    question, I will first
    consider the probabilities of the case, which are suggested by the
    course of public events: and then, secondly, I will come to the
    indications which are personal to Alfred himself. This plan may tend
    to clearness, though it be not feasible to keep the two aspects quite
    apart.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a basis to this enquiry, we must take the year 878, as being that
    in which the Jewel disappeared. This is now an established point in
    our argument. To this we were led both by history and by tradition:
    and it is only by keeping as close as possible to these that we can
    shun the proclivities of arbitrary hypothesis.
  </p>

  <p>
    1. Taking then the year 878 as that in which Alfred saw the Jewel
    for the last time, how far back must we recede to come to the most
    probable time for his inventing it? Our first step must be to skip
    the seven years since his accession in 871. A glimpse at the events
    of that period may suffice to assure us that the constant pressure of
    sterner duties would have left him in no mood to amuse himself with
    enamel and filigree. And even if for the sake of winter relaxation he
    had done so, I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
    he would not have designated himself as plain
    Ælfred, when he was king. During his reign his constant style was
    <span class="smcap">Ælfred cyning</span>, and it would have been quite easy to have
    added the letter R to his name, as his father did when he ordered the
    fashion of his ring. For these reasons (among others), I think the
    Jewel was made before 871.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may still recede another long step, and say that the date we seek
    was probably before 866. That is the year in which Alfred began to
    share the burden of reigning without the title, the year in which
    the common danger entered upon a new and more menacing phase, as the
    heathen invasion began to be more systematically conducted. Wessex was
    not indeed attacked until the last of these five years, but the whole
    period must have been passed in apprehension and intense preparation.
    Accordingly, this process of reasoning back from the year 878 by the
    light of public events brings us to the result that the design and
    execution of the Jewel is probably to be dated before <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
    866, that is to say, it must belong to the reign of king Æthelberht.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

  <p>
    2. Coming now to the second process, we have to consider at what
    time it appears likely that Alfred might have been in the mood for
    such a work as this, and also in circumstances (as to his immediate
    surroundings) favourable for artistic and allegorical meditation.
    When does it appear likely that he had leisure for thinking out these
    details, while at the same time his mind was exercised with the themes
    represented in the Jewel? It was certainly subsequent to his return
    from Rome; not immediately, but after an interval, when the first
    agitation of his mind had subsided, and he had become reconciled to
    his lot.
  </p>

  <p>
    For we cannot doubt that when he returned from Rome to England, and
    witnessed the state of his country—the danger and the depression—he
    must have experienced a great revulsion of feeling, a strong outburst
    of regret for the long and happy time that he had been enjoying
    abroad. His passionate yearning for Rome and his friends there must
    have amounted to something like a violent fit of home-sickness. All
    this it was his duty to live down; and to do so he had to look the
    facts in the face, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
    take their measure and their bearing, and
    ascertain their relation to his path of duty, and interpret his
    position by the light of a religious conscience. Some earnest and
    ardent minds would find solace and strength in writing poetry, and
    perhaps Alfred did so. If this Jewel is not the equivalent of such a
    poem it is nearly akin to it. In constructive art there certainly is a
    solace of a healing kind, and the Jewel before us answers remarkably
    to the situation. It is in many particulars like the outcome of such a
    mood. And if such a mood is likely to have followed the return of the
    young prince to England, it concerns us to form some opinion about the
    probable date of that event.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is asserted in the bilingual Chronicle (F) that Alfred returned to
    England on the occasion of his father’s death, which took place in
    January, 858; but the statement is discredited by considerations which
    Mr. Plummer has given in his notes to the <cite>Saxon Chronicle</cite> (vol.
    ii, p. 80). Two years later, in 860, his eldest brother, Æthelbald,
    king of Wessex, died; and this event occasioned a definite call for
    his return. The three brothers, Æthelbald, Æthered, and Ælfred,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
    held lands in common which were given by their father to these three sons,
    in such a way that the whole was to come to the latest survivor. This
    property would now pass to the two brothers, Æthered and Ælfred;
    and for the sanction of this transfer it was necessary that the
    parties should appear before the Witan. This transaction is related
    in Alfred’s Will. The two brothers agreed that their joint property
    should be held in trust by Æthelbriht, the new king, and that he
    should farm it for the benefit of his younger brothers, a trust which
    he fully discharged.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the death of Æthelbriht and the accession of Æthered in 866, the
    heathen invasion began to assume a more alarming form; but the reign
    of Æthelbriht had been a quiet time, at least for Wessex. This period
    (860 to 866), from Alfred’s thirteenth to his eighteenth year, would
    be a time of leisure, and he would be at the age of youthful reverie,
    and his mind would be stimulated by reports that would reach his ear
    of the savagery of the heathen raids in neighbour and kindred nations
    contrasted with the humanities of Christianity, while his memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
    would contrast the learned culture of Rome with the ignorance of his
    own people. These appear to be apt conditions for exercising the mind
    of a serious prince with such thoughts as we find symbolized in the
    Alfred Jewel.

  <p>
    In collecting evidence for the argument of this Essay, I have been
    solicitous to omit nothing that seemed to make for the credit of a
    Jewel, concerning which I am persuaded in my own mind that it bears
    the authentic signature of Alfred of Wessex. I hope that this aim
    has not betrayed me into the use of any arguments which are of no
    validity. And if any reader’s opinion should be against me on this
    point, I would ask him to consider that in the region of probability
    all men do not judge exactly alike: one may think a particular fact
    or tradition of no argumentative value, while another may hesitate to
    exclude it. And even if any such instance were disallowed and ruled to
    be of no weight, still it cannot invalidate the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    Morally, it may damage the effect of the whole, because it may
    prejudice the mind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
    the reader; but logically, it leaves the
    argumentative effect of the rest where it was before. Such being
    the case, I have leaned toward comprehension as being the more
    useful course; and if I have erred I hope I may claim the reader’s
    indulgence, on the ground of being faithful to the view which I had of
    the task before me.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this scientific age, there are more persons who can appreciate a
    train of exact serial reasoning than of those who can do justice to a
    combination of probabilities. It is not very rare to find disputants
    capable of testing a mathematical demonstration, who if they had to
    examine a probable argument might dismiss it with the proverbial
    maxim, which says that no chain is stronger than its weakest link.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are arguments which are like a chain, and to them the maxim
    applies: one weak link vitiates the conclusion. Such are the
    demonstrations in Euclid. But the argument which runs through this
    book is not of that kind, rather it resembles a bundle, and to such
    the maxim does not apply. It cannot be said, for example, that no
    faggot is stronger than its weakest stick. And this is the simile
    which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> applies to the evidence in probable reasoning. It is not
    linked, but massed.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Gulliver awoke on the shore of Liliput and found that he was
    fastened to the ground, the threads which bound him were severally
    slight, but the total effect was irresistible. Analogous thereto was
    the combined effect of many partial and inconclusive arguments on the
    mind of Sir Francis Palgrave, when he testified that ‘no one, taking
    all the points of evidence together, can reasonably doubt but that it
    did belong to king Alfred<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.’
  </p>

  <p>
    This conclusion may now be somewhat amplified. I trust we are now in
    a position to say with reasonable confidence, that not only did this
    Jewel belong to Alfred of Wessex, having been made by his order; but
    further, that it was his work, having been made after his design; and
    further again, that the design referred to, and was based upon, his
    own position; and, moreover, that the Jewel was a production of his
    youth, of the period after his return from Rome, and before he assumed
    a share in public affairs by the side of his brother Æthelred.

    <i>Part of a Letter from Dr. Musgrave, Fellow of the College of
    Physicians and R. S., to Dr. Sloane; concerning a Piece of Antiquity
    lately found in Somersetshire.</i>
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I enclose, to you, the Figure (see Fig. 4) of a curious piece
      of Antiquity, lately found near Ashelney in Somersetshire; the
      Place where King Alfred built, as Milton affirms, a Fortress: But
      according to William of Malmsbury, a Monastery; in Memory (as some
      have thought) of his Deliverance, obscure Retreat to that Place, and
      Concealment in it, from the Danes.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

    <p>
      The Substance is in the Possession of Col. P. of Fairfield in the
      same County; by whose Permission, I had the Sight of it. ’Tis of the
      same Length and Breadth with the Figure: the Work very fine; so as to
      make some Men question its true Age: But in all probability, it did
      belong to that great King, it is so well represented in the Figure,
      that a short Description will suffice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Edge is thin, as far as the Letters. The Letters are on a Plane
      rising obliquely. All within the inner Pyramidal Line is on a Plane
      equi-distant from the Reverse. The Representation (in that upper
      Plane) seems to be of some Person in a Chair. It is in Enamel,
      cover’d over with a Crystal; which is secured in its place by the
      little Leaves coming over its Edges. In the Reverse are Flowers
      engraved. The whole piece may be of the Weight of Three Guineas. The
      Chrystal and Enamel excepted, it is all of pure Gold.
    </p>

    <p>This, perhaps, was an Amulet of King Alfred’s.</p>

  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">Among</span> the tentative interpretations of the enamelled Figure both of
    these saints have at different times been put forward, as was only
    natural, since they both hold a place in the current narratives of
    king Alfred’s life. But it is well to observe that their several
    relations to the stream of tradition are neither equal nor alike.
    The first is found united with that stream in the tenth century,
    that is to say, at the highest point which has been reached in the
    investigation of these episodes. As to what is told of St. Neot,
    however unlikely, it cannot be pronounced impossible that it may have
    had some original right to the place which it holds. The second is a
    transparent fraud, introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
    in the twelfth century by wrong-headed zeal. A few details will make this clear.
  </p>

  <p>
    The oldest source for the life of St. Neot is an Anglo-Saxon
    homily of that well-known type which sprang out of the monastic
    revival associated with the names of Odo and Æthelwold and Dunstan.
    Conspicuous examples of this type are the Lives of St. Edmund, King
    and Martyr, and of St. Swithun.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this epoch the relics of St. Neot (by a traffic too intricate for
    us to unravel) were removed from their natural resting-place at St.
    Neots in Cornwall, where the man had lived and died, to enrich a new
    foundation in Huntingdonshire, where influential persons were planting
    a new monastery, which became a second St. Neots. We may pretty
    safely assume that this event, which happened about 984, gave rise
    to the biography, in which the relations of St. Neot to Alfred form
    the distinguishing feature. Of this writing only a late and somewhat
    interpolated copy has reached our times.
  </p>

  <p>
    The modern historian will not hesitate to say of St. Cuthbert that his
    relations to Alfred are wholly fictitious; but he cannot undertake to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
    say the same of St. Neot. Nevertheless, they are equally out of the
    question so far as regards the <i>icuncula</i>. The idea that the Figure
    might be St. Neot is excluded by the homily, which places the death of
    St. Neot shortly before the troubles of Alfred, and the accepted date
    is 877. According to the most probable chronology we have been able to
    make out for the Jewel, it was fabricated before 866.
  </p>

  <hr class="tb" />

  <p>
    The legendary connexion of St. Cuthbert with Alfred dates from the
    twelfth century, and is apparently due to Simeon the historian, who
    was a monk of the monastery of Durham, and who, when about thirty-five
    years old, witnessed the impressive ceremonial of the translation of
    the great saint of the North Country, which took place in 1104.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he compiled his narrative of the reign of king Alfred, he
    sacrificed facts of history to the fame of the saint. Omitting
    genuine details which he had at hand, he subjected the capital events
    of Alfred’s life to the patronage of St. Cuthbert. Thus he begins:
    ‘In the year 877 the nefarious host quitted Exeter and came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
    Chippenham and wintered there. King Alfred in those days endured great
    tribulations and lived an unsettled life. Being encouraged with an
    explicit oracle by St. Cuthbert, king Alfred fought against the Danes,
    at the time and in the place which the saint had directed, and gained
    the victory, and from that time forward he was terrible and invincible
    to his enemies. The manner in which he vanquished his foes is related
    as followeth.’
  </p>

  <p>
    In such a manner was this figment introduced into the page of history,
    where it long continued in good repute. Hickes was so much swayed by
    it, that he relinquished his first interpretation of the <i>icuncula</i> in
    favour of St. Cuthbert.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the connexion of Alfred with St. Neot is (as it may well be) of a
    mythical nature, or even an invention of the biographer, he did but
    use the licence which was then accorded to the panegyrist; and it is
    very different from that abuse of the authority of the historian which
    introduced St. Cuthbert into the narrative of the deeds of Alfred.

    <span class="smcap">I am</span> indebted to Miss Swann for the following extract from Professor
    Westwood’s <i>Miniatures and Ornaments of Anglo-Saxon and Irish Art</i> (p.
    29):
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The drawing representing (as I apprehend) the Temptation of the
      Saviour occurs on fol. 202 v., and is copied in my Plate XI.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here the bust of the Saviour is represented at the summit of an
      elaborately ornamented conical design, which I suppose represents a
      ‘pinnacle of the temple’ rather than the ‘exceeding high mountain.’
    </p>

    <p>
      The head of the Saviour is surrounded by a cruciferous nimbus, like
      that of the Virgin in the above-described drawing, and He appears to
      hold a roll in His left hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two very rudely designed angels hover above His head, and two others
      occupy the upper angles of the picture, the interstices of the latter
      being filled in with foliage and branches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
      springing from vases; that
      on the right hand being in an unusual position.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strangely emaciated black figure of the Tempter (destitute of
      tail, but with hoof-like feet), and the crowd of heads at the side
      and bottom of the design, as also the bust within a frame holding two
      rosette-bearing rods, merit particular notice.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    My interpretation of the Irish Figure was made solely from a study of
    the picture itself, without suggestion from any quarter. I had great
    difficulty in making up my mind whether the meaning were a personage
    at a window in the building, or whether it were simply a framed
    picture exhibited in front of the building. I was not then aware of
    Professor Westwood’s description, which takes the latter view. It is
    obvious that this view gives to the representation the nature of a
    reflection or comment more pointedly than the view which I have taken
    in the text.
  </p>

  <p>
    I will here add another quotation from Professor Westwood, in which
    he describes and characterizes the <cite>Book of Kells</cite>: ‘It is the most
    astonishing book of the Four Gospels which exists in the world, and
    it is in Trinity College,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
    Dublin, where it was placed along with
    the books of Archbishop Usher, after his death in 1656, where it has
    since remained, and where I trust it will ever remain, as the glory of
    Ireland’ (<cite>The Book of Kells: a Lecture</cite>, &amp;c., p. 6).

  <p>
    <span class="smcap">I am</span> greatly indebted to my friend Mr. C. F. Bell, the Assistant
    Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, for the following observations upon
    the technical characteristics of early <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cloisonnée</i> enamels. These
    observations are very germane to, and indeed were partly occasioned
    by, the questions which surround the Enamel in the Alfred Jewel.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Setting aside the reliquary at Poitiers, which, if it could really
      justify its claim to having been a gift of Justinian II to St.
      Radigund, would be by far the oldest piece of Byzantine enamel
      work in existence, as well as all such specimens as have no
      inscriptions or documentary evidence to indicate their age, there
      exist, apparently, only two enamelled objects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
      of supposed Byzantine
      workmanship that can be maintained to be older than the Alfred Jewel.
      These are the iron crown of Monza and the golden altar of Saint
      Ambrose at Milan.
    </p>

    <p>
      With regard to the first, apart from the controversy as to whether it
      truly was amongst the jewels given to the cathedral by Theodolinda,
      there seems to be some uncertainty as to whether there is any
      <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cloisonnée</i> enamel about the crown at all. Du Sommerard, who was
      allowed to make a drawing of it which is reproduced in his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Arts
      au Moyen Age</i> (Album, série x, pl. 14), speaks of incrustations
      of jewels, but makes no mention of enamel. His carefully coloured
      illustration shows the plaques described by Labarte (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Arts Industriels</i>, i. 312),
      but the emerald-green ground that figures in
      the description is not indicated. Du Sommerard’s plate fails in one
      or two other particulars to tally with Labarte’s description; and
      as the latter speaks of his difficulty in obtaining a sight of the
      crown, it is possible that he mistook in this instance, as he appears
      to have done in the case of the Limburg reliquary, what M. Molinier
      (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Trésor de Saint Marc de Venise</i>, p. 48) calls <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la verroterie
      cloisonnée</i>—that is, presumably, glass mosaic inlaid in golden
      cells—for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cloisonnée</i> enamel. At any rate, some fresh opinion is
      surely needed to establish the iron crown as a monument of this class
      of enamel work.
    </p>

    <p>
      To turn to the altar of Saint Ambrose. It was made in 838; and
      Labarte admits that the Latin inscriptions upon it, and the Latin
      name of its artist, proclaim the Italian origin of the greater part
      of the work. But the enamels which form a comparatively unimportant
      part of the decoration ‘doivent,’ he says, ‘avoir été exécutés par
      un des artistes grecs qui travaillaient en grand nombre en Italie
      à cette époque. On remarquera que les carnations des figures sont
      rendues en <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
      émail blanc opaque’ (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Histoire des Arts Industriels</i>,
      iii. 10). Of these enamels the most striking appear to be eight
      small, circular medallions upon the doors at the back of the altar.
      These medallions do not form an integral portion of the work, but are
      affixed, in the manner of jewels, to the framework of the silver-gilt
      bas-reliefs, and may in fact be amongst those very English enamels
      whose discovery upon the early shrines in continental churches and
      museums Mr. Starkie Gardner predicts (<cite>Catalogue of European Enamels
      exhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts Club</cite>, 1897, p. ix). Each
      represents a diademed head seen in full face, a palm branch, or
      perhaps a wing, appearing above each shoulder against a translucent
      green background. In motive they thus present an extraordinarily
      close parallel to the Alfred Jewel (Du Sommerard, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Arts au Moyen
      Age</i>, Album, série ix, planches 18 and 19).
    </p>

    <p>
      The earliest enamels of incontestably Byzantine origin, which can be
      dated with accuracy by documentary evidence, seem to go no further
      back than the beginning of the tenth century. It cannot, however, be
      said that these works, with those of closely subsequent periods, have
      the appearance of being the productions of the school in its infancy
      and early development. Very considerable technical accomplishment
      is shown in the manipulation of the extremely narrow gold cloisons,
      disposed for the most part in straight or slightly curved lines, and
      filling even the spaces of the drapery with closely laid chevrons or
      parallel stripes; while the innumerable minute cells thus formed are
      filled with homogeneous, brilliant, many-hued enamels. A warm tone of
      pink is invariably used to represent flesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      An impressive object, possessing certain characteristics in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>common
      with the Jewel and other supposed Celtic-Saxon enamels, is the eagle
      fibula found at Mainz, and now in the museum there. The present
      setting of the enamelled eagle has been supposed to be Frankish,
      of the latter part of the tenth or earlier years of the eleventh
      century, and the eight small enamelled jewels inserted in the border
      confirm this view, as they closely resemble the jewels incrusted upon
      the frame of the Crucifixion plaque in the Reiche-Capelle at Munich,
      which has usually been attributed to that age (Von Hefner-Alteneck,
      <i>Trachten des christlichen Mittelalters</i>; Schlumberger, <i>Nicephorus
      Phocas</i>). The figure of the eagle, presumably, consisted originally
      of five plaques, one representing the head, another the tail, two
      others the outspread wings, and a fifth the body of the bird. This
      last is missing, its place having been supplied, apparently at
      the time the setting was made, by a plaque of engraved gold. This
      circumstance seems in favour of the idea that the enamels are of
      foreign workmanship, and earlier than the setting.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cloisons of neither the eagle nor the Roach Smith ouche are as
      narrow as those employed by the Byzantine enamellers, although they
      are at most only half the width of those made use of in the Alfred
      Jewel. The doubling of the cloisons into loops, not commonly seen in
      Byzantine work but remarkable in the Jewel, is also noticeable in
      the eagle. Amongst the five colours employed in the eagle are the
      dark, translucent green, and the yellow, considered by Mr. Gardner
      as characteristic of Celtic-Saxon enamels, and also the opaque white
      such as is used for the flesh tint in the Jewel and the ouche, and,
      as Labarte particularly remarks, in the closely analogous heads upon
      the altar of Saint Ambrose.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

    <p>
      Of all these monuments the enamel of the Alfred Jewel is at once the
      coarsest and most primitive in execution. Having been protected by
      the rock-crystal pane, its surface is presumably in much the same
      state as when it left the maker’s hands. It was, evidently, when it
      came out of the furnace, extremely uneven and rough, and had to be
      subjected to a grinding process, traces of which are still apparent.
      The gold cloisons are dull with minute scratches, and where two ran
      close together they have become one confused, ragged line. Both the
      eagle and the ouche, although exposed for long periods to the direct
      action of the soil, preserve a far higher degree of polish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet the rough workmanship by itself cannot, it must be remembered,
      be held to preclude the Byzantine origin of this enamel, since, as
      there is not known to exist a single indisputably dated work of
      the Byzantine school in its primitive stages, it is impossible to
      assert that this school was not, during the lifetime of king Alfred,
      producing work as rude in execution as the Jewel. It may be that
      such a specimen will some day make its appearance, and determine
      the Eastern origin of this enamel and all cognate works. It is also
      possible that the discovery of an undoubtedly Irish example may place
      above all dispute the contention that it is of Celtic-Saxon origin,
      and finally justify the absorption into the same class of the ouche,
      the eagle, the eight medallions upon the altar of Saint Ambrose, nay,
      even of the crown of Theodolinda itself.

    The materials have doubtless passed into the neighbouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> farm
    buildings. The spot is marked by a monumental pillar, which was
    erected in 1801 by the then proprietor of the land, with an historical
    inscription, which is not too inaccurate for the time in which it was
    composed. It runs thus:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      King Ælfred the Great, in the year of our Lord 879, having been
      defeated by the Danes, fled for refuge to the forest of Athelney,
      where he lay concealed from his enemies for the space of a whole
      year. He soon after regained possession of the throne; and in
      grateful remembrance of the protection he had received, under the
      favour of Heaven, he erected a monastery on this spot, and endowed it
      with all the lands contained in the Isle of Athelney. To perpetuate
      the memory of so remarkable an incident in the life of that
      illustrious prince, this edifice was founded by John Slade, Esq., of
      Maunsel, the proprietor of Athelney, and lord of the manor of North
      Petherton, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1801.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The present representative of this gentleman is his
    great-great-grandson, Sir Cuthbert Slade of Maunsel, Bart., lord of
    the Manor of North Petherton.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Abbey of Athelney never attained to any considerable wealth or
    importance; but a sculptured boss, which was found on the site,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> and
    which is here figured in two aspects, after drawings by Mr. Alfred A.
    Clarke of Wells, seems to indicate some costly architecture among the
    abbey buildings in the fourteenth century.

    <span class="smcap">The</span> church of North Newton has features suggestive of ancient
    celebrity, but the dates which are historically known, do not mount so
    high as might have been expected. The tower, which is the oldest part,
    and to which the high antiquity of a thousand years has been popularly
    attributed, speaks by its architecture, which is here represented.
    The earliest known date connected with the fabric is 1292, in which
    year the foundation stone of the elder chapel was laid by Richard
    de Barfleur, called also Richard de Plesseto. This being a chantry
    chapel, the endowment was taken away in 1548, and the fabric decayed.
    In the time of Charles I, Sir Thomas Wrothe built a new chapel and
    provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
    a stipend for the minister, which still continues. The Parable Door,
    the Oak Screen, and the Pulpit are evidently of the same period, and
    were probably given by the same benefactor.

    The village of North Newton, originally a chapelry, was separated
    from the mother parish of North Petherton, and formed into an
    ecclesiastical parish on the twenty-third day of March, 1880. It is
    situated two miles north of Durston Station (Great Western Railway),
    four and a half south-west of Bridgwater, and seven north-east of
    Taunton. These particulars are taken from a little book entitled
    <cite>The Church and Parish of St. Peter’s, North Newton</cite>, by the Rev. L. H.

    <span class="smcap">I have</span> been favoured by Sir Alexander Acland Hood with the following
    extract from the Manuscript of Mr. Thomas Palmer, which is preserved
    in Fairfield House:—
  </p>

  <div class="center">‘NEWENTON, NEWTON, OR PETHERTON PARK.</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      ‘The Park and Manor of Newenton belonged to the King at the time of
      the general survey, and probably this is the Petherton where king
      John held his court. The House was on the north side of the Park,
      where there is now a tenement called Parker’s Field. At this place
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>a remarkable piece of antiquity was dug up in the year 1693, which
      is, by Dr. Hickes and other antiquaries, adjudged to have been of the
      age of King Alfred, the letters being such as were introduced by this
      King in imitation of the Roman Alphabet, and never used before or
      since.
    </p>

    <p>
      ‘Doctor Hickes interprets this inscription to be “Alfred ordered me
      to be made”; and supposes the enamelled figure to be the picture of
      St. Cuthbert, the tutelar saint of that King. The whole is of gold,
      over the enamel is a piece of rock crystal, half an inch thick: the
      gold rim is cut through to form the letters of the inscription. This
      is now among the antiquities of the University of Oxford.’
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The Keeper of the Archives (Mr. Bayne of Christ Church) has kindly
    made search at my request, and he writes: ‘I have gone carefully
    through the Convocation Register for 1718, and can find no reference
    to the Jewel, nor to Mr. Palmer who died 6 March, 1735.’
  </p>

  <p>
    The Register of Benefactions of the Ashmolean Museum has a paragraph
    in Latin, which however gives no information on this point.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

  <p>
    The most interesting piece I have found on this point is in
    Collinson’s <cite>History of Somerset</cite> (1791), vol. i, p. 87, where he is
    speaking of Athelney Abbey: it is as follows:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Some allusion to the vision of St. Cuthbert above-mentioned is
      supposed to have been intended by a little curious amulet of enamel
      and gold, richly ornamented, that was found in 1693 in Newton Park,
      at some distance northward from the abbey. On one side of it is a
      rude figure of a person sitting crowned, and holding in each hand a
      sceptre surmounted by a lily, which Dr. Hickes and other antiquaries
      have imagined to be designed for St. Cuthbert. The other side is
      filled by a large flower, and round the edge is the following legend:
      AELFRED MEC HEIT GEVVRCAN; that is, <i>Alfred ordered me to be made</i>.
      This piece of antiquity is now in the museum at Oxford, accompanied
      with the accounts of doctors Hickes and Musgrave, and the following
      memorandum: “Nov. 16, 1718, Tho. Palmer, esq; of Fairfield in
      Somersetshire, put this ancient picture of St. Cuthbert, made by
      order of king Alfred, into my hands to bee conveyed to y<sup>r</sup> Bodlean
      Library in Oxford, where his father Nat. Palmer, esq; lately dead,
      desired it might be placed and preserved.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
